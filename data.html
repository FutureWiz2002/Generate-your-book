    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <h2>History and Biography</h2>
    <p>
      The history of the Pre-Islamic Arabs was known only by means of narration,
      Arabic history even before the advent of Islam reflected the nature of
      their lifestyle. It showed their pride in their fathers and forefathers,
      heroism, generosity, loyalty, stories of ancestry and alliances. There
      were also nueratives about the history of the Ka'bah, the emergence of the
      well of Zamzam, the news of the tribe of Juthum and leaders of Quraysh,
      and the Ma'ib Dam whose collapse caused people to disperse in the land.
      There were also stories of diviners and their citations. Thus, history
      portrayed their socio-political and religious aspects of life, Islam
      appeared at the time when people were accustomed to report all these
      stories and events. With the beginning of the Message, preceded by
      portents of prophethood, the early life and up-bringing of the Prophet
      (pbuh), the Revelation and relevant events and attitudes of the Prophet's
      Companions. and enemies, the Prophe’s behavior and relations with
      Muslinis, disbelievers, Christians, and Jews, there emerged a protific and
      broad subject-matter of information and tidings which were also circulated
      through narration, Moreover, the Qur'an, the hadith, and the words of
      Companions, constituted a rich record of that new life. While the Qur'an
      was being written down, the hadith remained u trusted series of narration.
      In general no one had the courage to think of writing the hadith sa
      response to the Prophet's saying,
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      “Do not quote me (hy writing) far anything except the Qur'an, and whoever
      has quoted me (by writing) for anything other than the Qur'an should omit
      it.”
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      The wisdom behind this was obvious: it aimed at avoiding confusionbetween
      the Revelation and the Prophet's words during the time of Revelation.
      Undoubtedly, it was a temporary matter lasting until the whole Quran had
      been revealed,

      When “Umar ibn *Abdel- Aziz ruled (from 99 10 101 AH), he spent forry days
      pertorming Istikhdrah prayers asking Allah whether he should write down
      hadith or not. He continued until he felt Allah's approval. He then asked
      Abd Bakr ibn Muhammad ibn “Umar ibn Hazm (d- 120 AH), the ruler of Madinah
      at that time. to write down the hadith. He wrote down the hhadiths he had
      memorized in a book, which was sent to the provinces, “Umar ibn
      “Abdel-“Aziz also asked Muhammad ibn Muslim ibn Shihib ‘Az-Zati, the
      teacher of Malik, to write down hadith, and the later did so in book form.
      Afterwards, Muslims continued to write down whatever they knew of the
      Prophet's hadiths without keeping (o a particular form of sectioning or
      classification. For instance. while some set aside chapters on law, others
      began to classify hadith into chapters on the Prophet's birth until the
      Revelation, chapters on his state in Makkah, his proclamation to the
      Quraysh, who then persecuted him and his followers as well as information
      ‘on wars and matters of Jihad, Historians began to write general history
      books including the life of the Prophet (pbuh), thus satisfying their
      religious inclination to perceive him as an ideal model and guidance for
      Mustims, Biographers The first Prophetic biographers were: “Urwah ibn

      (d. 124 AH), and “Abdullah ibn Abi Bakr ibn Hazm (d. 135 AH). All their
      books perished with the exception of some parts which were scattered
      throughout main references on history like Af-Tabari’s book of history.

      in Germany, After this came another generation of biographers. the most
      renowned of which were Mais ibn “Ugbah (d. 141 AH), Muammar ibn Rashid (d.
      150 AH), and Muhammad Iba Ishiig (4. 152 AH). This generation was followed
      by Ziyal al-Bukai (d. 183 AH), Al-Wagidi the author of Al-Maghazi (d. 207
      AH), Th Hishdm (d. 218 AH), and Muhammad ibn Sad the author of ALTabagat

Biographers

The first Prophetic biographers were: “Urwah ibn az-Zubayr ibn
Al- Awwim (d. 92 AH), Abin ibn “Uthman (d. 105 AH), Wahb ibn
Munabbah (d. 110 AH), Sharhabil ibn Su'd (d. 123 AH), Ibn Shihab

All their books perished with the exception of some parts which were
scattered throughout main references on history like Af-Tabari’s book of
history. Only & piece of Wahb ibn Munabbah’s book is currently stored in
Heidelburg in Germany,

After this came another generation of biographers. the most renowned of
which were Mais ibn “Ugbah (d. 141 AH), Muammar ibn Rashid (d. 150
AH), and Muhammad Iba Ishiig (4. 152 AH). This generation was followed
by Ziyal al-Bukai (d. 183 AH), Al-Wagidi the author of Al-Maghazi (d.
207 AH), Th Hishdm (d. 218 AH), and Muhammad ibn Sad the author of
ALTabagat (4.230 AH).


<br><br><br>

Of all the above mentioned early biographers, the biography written by
Thn Ishaq” was the most renowned and highly documented. He wrote in the
early Abbasid period. It was said that fbn Ishq visited Al-Manstr in
Baghdad along with his son, Al-Mahdi. Al-Manséir said to him. ‘Do you
know who this man is, thn Ishaq?” tn Ishq replied, “Yes, he is your son,
Commander of the Believers.” He said, “Go, and write a book for him on
the creation of Allah since Adam up to this day.” Ibn Ishdg did as he was
told. Then Al-Mansir said to him, “You have made it so big tn Ishiq. go
and summarize it”. He did and the book was shelved in the treasury of the
Commander of the Believers.

After half a century, Ibn Hishdm® rewrote this biography through one
person, Ziyad Al-Buka’i, Ibn Ishiq's book, which he wrote, was not in the
form that it has today. This is because thn Hishiim examined bn Ishiq's
biography of the Prophet (pbuh) by editing. abridging, making additions,
and sometimes criticizing and objecting through the narrations of other
scholars, He even utilized part of his methodology of narration.

‘There is no doubt that Ibn Hishdm was honest and that he conformed in
his vitation of Ibn Ishiq’s book. He never changed or added a word of Ibn
Ishig unless he was explaining or refuting @ narration, when he would refer
to a modification by stating "Ibn Hisham sai

His main purpose of citing thn Ishiq’s biography was to make an
abridgment, He deleted all that bad been mentioned before the history of
{Isma‘il the son of Ibrahim (peace be upon them both) as well as stories and
information of Ismi jon, did not serve the
Prophet's (pbuh) biography. He also eliminated all the long controversial
poems. If anyone compared the original text of Ibn Ishig and Tha Hisham’s
narration, he would find that he was very careful and utterly honest, which
were characteristics of the Muslim scholars of that time.

The Status of Ibn Hisham's Biography
of the Prophet (pbuh)

Undoubtedly, thn Ishiq's book was and will continue 10 be a major
reference for readers of the Prophet's (pbul)) biography. No one plunged into
the life of the Prophet Muhammad (pbuh), without referring to Ibn Ishiq's
ook as a major source of information,

For a very long time the biography written by Ibn Ishig was known
among scholars as the biography by Ibn Hishdm because Tbn Hishim
narrated and edited it. Tho Khalgin said, “Ibn Hishim is the one who
compiled the biography of the Messenger of Allah (pbuh) from the battles
and stories narrated by Ibn Ishiq and it is the biography in the peopl
hands, known as the biography by Ibn Hishim.” This work was studied
carefully by commentators. For instance, Abul-Qasim *Abdur-Rabmén
as-Suhayli'"! (d. 581) presented an extensive annotation of the biography in
his book, Ar-Rawd al-Anf

Abridging the Prophet's (pbuh) Biography by Ibn Hisham

Early in my youth!’ { attempted several times to read this venerable
work from beginning to end but I failed due to the disturbing digression in
writing that made it tiresome, I read various passages dispersed throughout
it, which were like meadows in a desert, They attracted me because of the
beautiful expression and the glory of their aim.

Nevertheless, | felt, while reading the biography of the Prophet. (pbuh)
something of what I enjoy in reading the Quran or the Prophet's hadiths, of
sincere worship and devotion. A deep-seated motivation drove me to repeat
my endeavors to read the biography: my father was among those who wrote
about the Prophet's (pbuh) biography. He abridged it in a book of thirty
chapters entitled —Talkhis- —ad-Drits—_al-Awwaliyyah _fis-Sirah
al-Muhammadiyyah (A Summary of Preliminary Lessons in the
Muhammad's (pbuh) Biography), which was for a long time the only book
to.be taught in the Sirah courses of the religious institutes in Egypt.

However, 1 was not capable of reading the whole book because, as 1
have mentioned, there is a disturbing digression in writing, The reader of
Sirah encounters long chapters of names of captives of the Battle of Badr,

<br><br><br>

names of the horses of Muslims in this Battle, a list of the Muslims who
uttended Badr from among the Quraysh and from the Ansar, those who were
martyred on that day and so on of listings, prolix poems, lengthy lineage,
wordiness, and also including some Qur‘anic commentaries which are
irrelevant to the core of Sirah. In addition, chains of authorities on which
Sirah: is based were spelled out, which might be important only for scholars
of criticism,

In this “abridgment”, I tried to extract elements from the original work to
present it in a new form that is allowed for uninterrupted reading, while
being careful about the original text so the reaider could cite it. 1 did not
replace a letter of the original text so as to be honest in performance. 1
referred 10 Ibn Hishim’s wordings in the beginning of the subject or in
footnotes, but the whole text is of Ibn Ishaq as narrated by Tbn Hisham. 1
‘mentioned the chain of authorities only when it was indispensable for the
subject by quoting what had been reported by tbn Ishiiq or Ibn Hisham.

To make the text coherent, | interpreted what was needed of explanation,
relying on accredited Sirwh commentaries and linguistic references,
Abridgement is a kind of facilitation for those who are unable to read the
original and it serves to link today's youth to their heritage. Allah willing,
you would be able to read this book in a few days and acquire an immediate
benefit, while reading the original, if possible, would take a few months,

1 ask Allah to make this book useful, as it is a small contribution to
science, aiming for the satisfaction of Allah and that of the Prophet, prayers
and peace be upon him.

Ibn Ishiq had examined in this book which did not mention the Prophet

poems which were unknown to those specialized in poems as well as
anything repulsive, misstatements of some people and some things which
were not admitted by Al-Bukaii” to be narrated. Otherwise | will write

A Follow up of the Lineage
(from the Descendants of Isma*il (pbuh)

Ismail, son of Ibrahim, had twelve sons: Nabit, Qaydar, Adhbal, Misha,
Masma'a, Méshi, Dimi, Adhar, Tima, Yutdra, Nabash, and Qaydhumd.
Nabit son of Ismi°7l begot Yashjub who begot Ya'rub who begot Tayrab
who begot Nahir who begot Mugawwitn who begot Udad who begot
“Adnan. From “Adniin, tribes were dispersed from Ismiil's line. “Adnan
begot two sons: Ma‘add and “Akk, “Akk settled in Yemen afier marrying
from the Ash‘ari people. so the home and language became one. ‘The
Ash*ari people were descendents of Ash’ar ibn Nabt ibn Udad ibn Humaysi
ibn “Amr ibn *Arib ibn Yashjub ibn Zayd ibn Kahiin ibn Yashjub ibn
Yatrub ibn Quhtin. As for Ma°add, the other son of “Adnan, he begot four
sons: Nizir, Quii'ah, Qanas, and Tyad. Qud’ah Went to Himyar iba Saba’
in Yemen, and Qanas were said to have perished and all the other sons of
Mi‘add, among whom was An-Nu’ min ibauMundhir who was the king of
Hirah.

The Vision of Rabi*ah ibn Nasr

Rabi‘ah ibn Nasr the king of Yemen saw a dream which terrified him,
Afier sending for all diviners, sorcerers, and fortune-tellers, he told them
about it.

Rabi'ah said, “I saw a vision which terrified and frightened me, so tell
me about its interpretation.”

They replied, “Tell it to us and we will interpret.”

Rabi'ah: "IFT spell it out (o you, T will not feel satisfied about your
interpretation, No one will know its interpretation unless he knows it before
tell him."

One of them: “If our king wants that, he can send to Satth and Shigg
since no one is as knowledgeable as these two to tell himn what he asks.”

He brought them both. Satih met him before Shigg.

<br><br><br>

Rabr'ah: “l saw a dream which terrified and frightened me, so tell me
what it is. If you are right in knowing it, you will be able to give the right
interpretation.”

Satity "I will do. You saw a blaze coming out from the darkness, fell on
an earth depression, and ate all skulls."

Rabi

“You are right Satih, so what is your interpretation?”
Satib: “I swear that the Abyssinians will occupy your land and seize
from Abyan to Jurash (two Yemeni towns).”
Rabi°ah: "O Satih this is raging and painful, when will it be? Will it be
during my time or after me?"

Satib: "After your time by more than sixty or seventy years!"

Rabi'al

Satib: "It will end after more than seventy, then they will be fought and
expelled and will flee.”

Rabj'ah: “Then who will succeed them?"

Satih: “Iram ibn Dhi Yazan who will come from Aden to expel them all
from Yemen.”

: “Will their reign continue or will it end?”

Rabiah: "Will his reign continue or will it end?”

“Iwill end.”

Rabi ah: "Who will end it?”

Satih: "A chaste Prophet who will be inspired from the heavens.”
Rabi'ah: "Who is this Prophet?"

Satth: "A descendant of Ghalib ibn Fihr ibn Malik ibn An-Nadr, and the

Rabi'ah: "Is it true what you are saying?”

Satih: "Yes, by twilight and dusk and daybreak when it comes, what I
am informing is true.”

—Gn—.


<br><br><br>

When Shigg came, the king told him what he had told Saiih but he
concealed what Satihy had said, so us to see whether they would agree or
disagree.

Shiqg: "You saw a blaze coming out from the darkness, fell between a
meadow and hill, and ate all people.”

When he told him this, he knew that they agreed although Satih said
“fell on an earth depression, and ate all skulls” and Shigg said, “fell between

during my time or after me?”

‘Shiqg: "No after you for a period of time, then you (i.e. your nation) will
be rescued by a powerful notable person who will suffer disgrace and

Shigg: “It will end with the advent of a revealed Messenger who will
come with truth and justice among the people of religion and grace. Power

Rabi’ ah: "What is the Day of sorting out?”

‘Shigq: "A day when the rulers will be recompensed, supplications will
come from the heavens heard by those alive and dead, and all will be
brought together for an appointed time, when those who were pious will
triumph and have charitable benefits."

Rabi'ah; “Is it true what you are saying?”

Shigg: "Yes by the Lord of heaven and earth, and what ascends and
descends in between them, what I am informing you of is undoubtedly the truth."

Rabi'ah ibn Nasr believed what they (Satih and Shiqq) said, so he
equipped his houschok to go to Iraq, He sent a letter to a Persian king,
‘Sabar ibn Khurzd, and they stayed in Hirah.

Seizure of Yemen by Aba Karb Tuban As*ad

“And his Invading Yathrib”

When Rabi'ah ibn Nast died, the reign of Yemen fell to Hassin ibn
‘Tuban Asa’d, known as Abd Karb. His father, Tub’in Asad went his way
from the East to Madinah (Yathrib) but he did mot attack its people,
However, he left his son there who was assassinated. Then, he conquered
the place once more with the intention to demolish and annihilate it. A
group of people headed by “Amr ibn Tallah were gathered for him and they
fought each other in Madinah. The Ansiir said that they used to fight him at
daytime and host him at night, He liked that and said, “By Allah, these
people are generous.”

While ‘Tubsin As‘ad (also called Tubbs’) was fighting, wo
knowledgeable Jewish rabbis who were firmly established in knowledge
and knew that he wanted to annihilate Madinah and its people, said to him,
“O king, do not do it. If you refuse there will be an interposition between
you and it (Madivah) and we are not sure that you may be immediately
punished.” He asked them, “Why this?” They replied, “It is the place of
Immigration sought by a Prophet who will come from the Inviolable place
(in Makkah) from the Quraysh in the latter period’, to have it as his home
and settlement.”

He stopped what he was doing, as he found the two rabbis were
knowledgeable. He was pleased with their words, so he left Madinah and
converted to their religion.

Tubba’ and his people had been idol worshippers. While they were
heading to Makkah on their way to Yemen, between “Usfan and Amaj (a
town between Makkah and Madinah) a group of Hudhay! ibn Mudrikah said
to him, "O king, may we guide you to a house of treasury disregarded by

Fi

kings before you, which contains pearls, aquarnarine, corundum, gold, and
silver?"

Tubba*

‘The group: "A house in Makkah which is worshipped by its people
where they offer prayers.”
In this way. those of Hudhay! wanted to get rid of him, since they knew

that whichever king wanted to own the house or tyrannize its place, was
doomed to death. The king asked the two rabbis about what was told to him.

es."

Rabbis: “They want to get rid of you and your soldiers. We know that no
‘one can have the House of Allah on earth, If you followed them you would
definitely perish as well as all who are with you.”

‘Tubba*: “What do you suggest me to do when Teach it?”

Rabbis: "Do what its people do; circumambulate around it and glorify it,
be generous there, shave your head. and yield to it until you leave.”

‘Tubba*: "What prevents you both from that?"

Rabbis: "By Allah itis the House of our father Ibrahim and it is as we
told you but its people interposed between us and the House by the idols
they stationed around it and the blood they shed there. They are impure
people associating others with Allah.”

Believing in the sincerity of their discourse, he followed their advice, so.
when confronted the group of Hudhay! he cut off their hands and legs. Then
he reached Makkah. He circumambulated the House, sacrificed there, and
shaved his head. He spent six days at Makkah sacrificing to feed its people
and gave them to honey drink. He saw a dream that he covered the House
(with cloth). Thus, he covered it with very thick cloth: then he dreamt that
he should cover it with a beter quality, so he covered it with Yemeni cloth.

It was said that Tuba’ was the first to cover the House. He charged his
followers of Jurhum to clean themselves, not to approach it with blood, dead
bodies, or any filthy items. He made a gate and a key for it. Taking his
soldiers and the two rabbis, he left Makkah to Yemen. He called his people
in Yemen to join his new religion. They refused to do so unless he stands
before the arbitration of fire.

difference: they believed that it eats up the oppressor and does not harm the
‘oppressed, Hence, his people came with their idols and what they used to
sacrifice in their religion. The two rabbis put their (holy) books on their
necks sitting by the fire from which it would emerge. When the fire
approached them, they tried to avoid it ont of fear. The attending people
blamed them and told them to be patient. They held patience then the fire
ate up the idols and things that they had sacrificed for them, as well as men.
from the people of Himyar who were carrying them. The two rabbis with
their books, appeared perspiring but the fire did not harm them. Since then
the people of Himyar converted to (the rabbis’) religion, and that was the
beginning of Judaism in Yemen

When his son Hassin ibn Tubin Asad became king, he urged the
‘Yemenis to conquer the lands of both the Arabs and non-Arabs. When they
reached the land of Bahrain, the Yemeni people did not want to continue but
desired to return to their country. They tesorted to Hassdin’s brother, “Amr,
who was among them, urging him to kill his brother (Hassin) and take over
the rule and return with them to Yemen. All agreed with the idea except for
Dhd Ru‘ayn al-Himyari who forbade him from that, but he did not respond
to him, Dhd Ru‘ayn wrote on a parchment that “Amr would be deprived of
Sleep because of his betray, then he sealed the paper and gave it to “Amr.
Aficrwards, “Amr killed Hassin and returned to Yemen with his army.

In Yemen “Amr was deprived of sleep and became overwhelmed by
insomnia. He asked doctors, diviners, and seers, and one of them said to
him, "By Allah no one tyrannically killed his brother or any of his blood
relatives like you did but was deprived of sleep and overwhelmed by
insomnia.” When he heard that, he killed every person who bad incited him
to kill his brother Hassan, until it came to Dhd Ru’ayn.

Dhi Ru’ayn: "I have an acquittal from you."

Amr: "What is it?”

Dh Ru’ayn: "The written parchment 1 gaye you.”

When he brought it out and read the words on it, he knew that he had
advised him (through his pre:

He brought the Himyar kingship back to rule the Yemeni tribes for a
long time. He was the last king of Himyar and he was the maker of the pit.
In Najrdn, there were people of grace and honesty and who were Christians.
‘They were led by “Abdullah ibn Ath-Thamir. Dha Nuwas went to them with
his soldiers to force them to convert into Judaism. Having refused to do so,
they were thrown alive into a large pit where a great fire had been lit. He
also killed others by the sword. About twenty thousand were killed,
including their leader “Abdullah ibn ath-Thimir, The Qur‘an refers to this
event:

(ALBurij: 4-8)

The Abyssinian Victory over Yemen

One of them (ie. the Christians of Najran), called Daws Dhd
Thu'lubin, slipped away on his horse and reached the Roman Emperor
where he sought support against Dh Nuwiis and his soldiers and told him
what they had made. The Roman Emperor told him that his country was far,
so he would write (o the Abyssinian king who was Christian as well and



<br><br><br>

more adjacent to Yemen, Daws went to The Negus (the Abyssinian King)
with the Emperor’ leter to support Daws to get viclory and take revenge.
He returned to Yemen with the help of seventy thousand Abyssinian

auriors «nder the leadership of Aryat. Among the warriors was Abrahah
al-Ashram. Arya{ went bis way through the sea until he reached the Yemeni
shores. When they met Dhi Nuwis and his Yemeni adherents, Dhi Nuwés
realized that he would be defeated so he directed his horse towards the sea,
fell into the water and drowned. Arya was granted rule over Yemen,

The Dispute between Aryat and Abrahah

Arylit spent years on the Thrown of Yemen, Abrahah disputed with him
over Abyssinian matters in Yemen until the Abyssinians becume disunited,
with a section aligned to each of them. They were incited against each other.
When the two groups approached each other and then Abrahah sent to
Arya

Abrahah: "You will not benefit if the Abyssinians fall against each other
to the point of extermination. Come, and let us duel each other. The winner
will have the warriors of the other."

Aryfit: "This is fair.”

Abrahah, a stout, short man, confronted Aryat, a handsome, mighty, and
tall man carrying a bayonet. Behind Abrahiah stood a lad called “Atwadah to
support his back. Aryat threw the bayonet aiming at the top of Abrahah's
‘head but it fell on his forehead slitting his eyebrow, eye, nose, and lip. That
is why he was dubbed Abrahab al-Ashram (Abrahah the Slit). “Atwadah
attacked Arydt from the buck and killed him, Aryit's soldiers joined
Abrahah's, and so an Abyssinian unification emerged in Yemen,

The Story of the Companions of the Elephant

Abrahah built a church called Al-Qullyas in San‘a’ that had no
equivalent in its time on earth. He sent to The Negus: "I have built for you,
O King. a church an equivalent of which has never been built for any king
before you. I will do my best to make the Arabs perform pilgrimage to it.”

—ip—


<br><br><br>

When the Arabs knew about Abrahah’s letter to the Negus, one of the
calendar intercalators'"” got angry. He went to Al-Quilyas, urinated there
and returned home. Being informed about this event, Abrahah asked, "Who
did it” He was answered, "He is an Arab of those of the House (the Ka" bah)
to which people perform pilgrimage, When he heard about your saying ‘t
will make the Arabs perform pilgrimage to it’ he was infuriated and urinated
in it to show that this place was not eligible for pilgrimage.”

Abrihal was enraged and swore 10 march and demolish the House.
Afier equipping and deploying the Abyssinians, he marched with soldi
having elephants pointing towards the House. The Arabs heard about this
and were terrified but insisted on fighting the approaching army.

A Yemeni notable called Dha Nafr instigated his people and other Arabs
to fight against and restrain Abrahah from his attack and plan to demolish
the Inviolable House. However, when they fought Abrahah, they were
defeated and Dhi Nafr was taken captive.

Pursuing his target, Abrahah reached the land of Khath"am but was
resisted by Nufay! ibn Habib al-Khath’ami who led the Arab tribes, Again
Abralras vanquished him and took him captive. Afterwards he released him
and used him as a guide, Passing by T#if, Mas‘Od ibn Mu'attib among
others from Thagif said to Abrahah: "O king, we are your slaves, obedient
to you, having no disagreement with you. This house ~ they meant AFLat
{an idol) - is not what you are seeking, you want the House in Makkah, We
will send with you someone to guide you.” They sent Abd Righdl as a guide
who accompanied him to Mughammas (a place near Makkah) where AbO
Righil died and was buried. Abrahah sent an Abyssinian called Al-Aswad
ibn Mafgad by horse to Makkah. He robbed the Quraysh and other tribes,
including two hundred camels belonging to *Abdul-Muttalib, who was then
master of the Quraysh. Quraysh, Kinanah and Hudhay! and all who were in.
and around the Inviolable House wanted to fight him but they realized they
would not be able to.

Abrahah sent Hundjah al-Himyari to “Abdul-Muttalib, with a message
saying that be did not want war with the people of Makkah. He only wanted



<br><br><br>

to destroy the House, so if the peaple of Makkah did not try to stop him
from destroying it, there would be no need to fight. Abrahah asked Hundtah
to see *Abdul-Muttalib in ease he did intend to fight him. “Abdul-Muutalib’s
answer was, "By Allah, we do not want to fight him; we cannot resist him.
‘This iy Allah’s inviolable House, which was built by His Intimate Friend
brahim. If He prevents him from it, it is His House and Shrine, and if He
allows him, so we cannot prevent him.

*Abdul-Muttalib and some of his sons went with Hundtah until they saw
some enemy soldiers. “Abdul-Muttalib asked about Dhé Nafr, who was his
friend. He visited him in prison.

*Abdul-Muyialib: "O Dhd Nafr can you not help in what has happened?”

Dh Nafr: "What kind of help can there be from a captive in the hands
of a king, waiting to be killed morning or evening? There is nothing ean do
for you but I will send to Anis, the elephant rider, who is a friend of mine. 1
will recommend that you meet the king and tell him whatever you want, and
to intercede for your good, if he can."

*Abdul-Muttalib: "I hope so.”

Dh Nafr sent to Anis,

Dhé Nafr: “ Abdul-Muytalib is the master of Quraysh and owner of
Makkah's trade caravans. He feeds people in the plain and beasts in the

mountain. The king took two hundred camels from him, Get him a
permission to meet him, and intercede for his good with whatever you ean.”

Anis: "E will do so.”
Anis spoke to Abrahah.

Anis: "O king, here is the master of Quraysh at your door who wants
your permission to enter. He is the owner of Makkah’s trade caravans. He
feeds people in the plain and beasts in the mountain, Let him ask you about
his request.”

Abrahah allowed him to enter. “Abdul-Muttalib was very handsome and
‘mighty. When Abrahah saw him, he praised him and allowed him to sit
tunder him since he disliked that the Abyssinians see him sitting on the royal
throne beside him, so he let him sit on the carpet and he sat down beside

hhim. He told the interpreter to ask him about his request. “Abdul-Muialib
replied, "My request is to have back my two hundred camels which were
taken from me.” When the interpreter told him his request, Abrahah
commanded him to say to him, "I was impressed when I saw you; now I
have lost interest in you after talking to me, Are you asking me about the
two hundred camels which I have taken and saying nothing about the House
that ropresents your religion and the religion of your forefathers which 1
have come to destroy?” “Abdul-Muttalib replied, "I am the owner of the
camels and the House has an Owner Who will defend it.” Abrahah replied,
“Nothing will stop " “Abdul-Muttalib sid, "We shall see.”

After taking his camels back, “Abdul-Mujtalib returned to the Quraysh
and informed them of Abrahah’s intention. He ordered them 10. leave
Makkah seeking shelter at the top of the mountains so as to avoid attack
from the army. “Abdul-Muttalib held the knocker of the Kabah and
supplicated to Allah with a group of the Quraysh to give them victory over
Abrahah and his soldiers.

‘Then they sought safety in the mountains waiting for what Abrahah was
(0 do in Makkah, In the morning. Abrahah proceeded to Makkah,
zed the army, and prepared the elephant that was called Mabini
Abrahah had decided to rewwrn to Yemen after demolishing the Kabah,
When the elephant was pointed towards Makkah, Nufayl ibn Hibib
whispered in the elephant’s ear, “Kneel down or go back to where you have
came, You are in the Inviolable town of Allah.” When he left his ear. the
elephant knelt down, Nufayl quickly climbed the mountain. The troops beat
the elephant to muke it get up but it would not; they beat its head with iron
bars, but it would not get up. Whenever they made it face towards Syria or
Yemen it would immediately get up and start off. Then suddenly birds like
swallows and starlings came from the sea, and with every bird were three
lentil-like and chickpea-like stones. one in its beak and two in its claws.
Everyone who was hit by any of these stones died. Those who were not hit
fled. but on their way back, they were falling down and dying. Abrabat was
affected in his body and died.

Ibn Ishaq said. “When Allah sent the Prophet Muhammad (pbuh), it was
a great blessing of Allah to count on the Quraysh that He saved them from
the Abyssinians. Allah the Almighty say's in the Qur'an,

The Digging of Zamzam
and Disputes concerning it

While “Abdul-Muttalib was sleeping under the shade of the Ka’bah
someone commanded him in a dream to dig Zamzam. “ Abdul-Muttalib said,
"While 1 was sleeping in the shade of the Ka’buh someone came to me
saying, ‘Dig Tibah.” I said, ‘What is Tibah”” Then he went away. The next
day while [ was in bed sleeping. He came to me saying, ‘Dig Al-Madndnab’
I said, ‘What is Al-Madninah? Then he went away. The next day while
sleeping in bed be came to me saying, ‘Dig Zamzam. I said, ‘What is
Zameam” He said, T never depletes nor its water lessens; it is to provide
water for pilgrims; it is between excretions and blood, at the rap of the crow
with whitish wings."

When he discovered the place, knowing that his vision had come true, he
took his spade and was accompanied then by his only child, Al-Harith. and
Started digging. Once the stones covering a well appeared he exclaimed
with, “Alldhu Akbar’, The Quraysh then knew that he had reached his target.
‘They crowded around him and asked, “O *Abdul-Muttalib it is the well of

He replied: "No, 1 will not do that. This matter was especially detegated to
me, not you." They said, "Be fair. We will not leave and we will be upset
with you." He said, "So let us have whoever you want as an arbitrator.”
‘They answered: “The she-diviner of Band Sa'd Hudhaym." He said. “¢
She was near Syria. “Abdul-Muttalib traveled to her with a group from Band
Abd Mandif and a group from every tribe belonging to the Quraysh. The
land was then in the wilderness. When they reached the wildemess between
Hie and Syria, “Abdul-Murtalib and his companions ran out of water to the
extent that they were dying of thirst. They asked for water from the others
of the Quraysh but they refused to give them (water) saying, "We are in the
wilderness and we are afraid of suffering from what you are now suffering
from.” When °Abdul-Muttalib saw the people's attitude and being fearful of
what would happen to himself and his companions, he said, "What do you
think?” They answered, "We will do what you think, so command us
whatever you want.” He said, “I think every one of you should dig his own
pit with whatever strength he has. Whenever any of you dies his
‘companions will put him in his pit and cover his body with dust, until only
‘one person will remain. This is because if one person temains unburied it
will be easier than the remaining of a whole group unburied,” They agreed
and everyone dug his pit and started waiting for death. Afterwards,
“Abdul-Muttalib said, "By Allah, we are casting ourselves by our hands to
death without striking in the earth seeking for ourselves. This is weakness. It
may be that Allah will provide us with water in some place, so let us ride
on.” They rode with the other people of Quraysh who were watching them
‘to see what they would do. “Abdul-Mutialib rode his camel, and when it
moved a fresh water spring gushed forth from underneath its hooves.
*Abdul-Muutalib said, “Allahu Akbar’ and so did his companions. They
descended and kept on drinking and filling up their pots,

‘They invited the tribes of the Quraysh, “Come to the water that Allah
has made us drink from, Come and drink and fill your pots.” After drinking
‘and filling up their pots, they said, "Surely Allah decreed for you against us,
Abdul-Munalib. By Allah, we will never dispute with you over Zamzam.
‘The One Who provided you to drink this water in this desert is the One Who
provided you with Zainzam, so return straightaway to your source of

water-giving. They all returned without reaching the she
teft Zamzam to him.

“Abdul-Muttalib Vows
to Slaughter a Son of his

‘The Quraysh’s initial attitude towards the digging of Zamzam made
Abdul Mittalib ibn Hashim, make a Vow, that if Allah would bless him with
ten sons who would grow to manhood, he would sactifice one of them to
Him at the Kabah, When his sons became ten and reached maturity. he
gathered thetn to inform them about his vow, calling them to fulfil his oath,
‘They accepted. He said, “Everyone of you will take a wooden arrow, write
his name on it, and then come to me.” They did and went to him. He took
them to Hubal (an idol) located on a well at the Ka°bah. Everything that was
devoted to the Kabah was gathered in that well

‘At Hubal there were seven wooden arrows, and each one of them
contained a message. (For instance), an arrow was made for “blood-money";
whenever they disputed on whom to take it, they would east the seven
arrows; if the arrow carrying the word blood-money cate out for a certain
person, he would have to pay. An arrow, an which "yes" is written and
another with “no” for 4 matter on which the Jot had been summoned. On
another was “of you” , another mulsaq (not a tribe member), another “other
than you” and the last carried the word “water”

Whenever they wanted to dig for water, they made the divination
including this arrow, and they applied the outcome. On circumeising a boy,
ranging for i marriage, burying corpse, or doubting the lineage of a
person, they went to Hubal to give the man responsible for casting lots, a
hundred dirhams and a slaughtered camel. Then they would approach the
‘one whom they were concerned with saying, "O our god, this so and so, the
son of so and so, and we want for him so and so; show us what is right to do
for him.” They would then say to the man responsible for the arrows,
“Cast”. If the arrow bearing “of you” came forth, then he was of a pure
descent of their tribe: if it was the arrow of “other than you" then he was an
ally, Whereas if the answer was mulsag he was considered neither a blood




<br><br><br>

relative nor an ally. When “yes” came forth in other issues, they acted
accordingly; and if it was “no” they delayed the subject for a year until it
would be raised again. Thus, they administered their affairs according to the
judgement of the arrows.

~Abdul-Muttalib asked the man responsible for the arrows to cast lots for
his sons, using the arrows which bore their names, telling him about the
vow. His sons gave the man the arrows. "Abdullih (at that time) was the
‘youngest and most favored son of “Abdul-Muttalib, so he thought that if the
‘arrow missed, he would be spared. When the man began shuffling. the
arrows, “Abdul-Muttalib stood at Hubal supplicating to Allah, Then the man
shuffled the arrows, * Abdullah's name came forth. “ Abdul-Muttalib took bis
son by the hand and a rizor to sacrifice him at Isif and Niilah (idols).
However, the men of the Quraysh left their assemblies to ask him what he
was going to do. He told them that he would slaughter him. The Quraysh
and his sons dissuaded him by saying. "By Allah you will never slaughter
hhim unless there is an established excuse. If you do it, every man will go
and slaughter his son, and what will become of people then?” Then
Al-Mughirah ihn “Abdullah ibn “Umar ibn Makhzim, who was of the
maternal cousins, said, "By Allah you will never slaughter him unless there
is an established excuse. If his ransom be of our wealth we will pay. The
Quraysh and his sons advised him to go to Hijte where there was a
she-diviner who had a familiar spirit, so he would ask hier, having freedom
of action; if she told him to slaughter, he would do so, while if she ordered
hhim with a matter. which would be good for bim as well as for his son, he
would readily accept it

‘They went to Madinah and heard that she was in Khaybar, Then they
rode on until they reacted her. When “Abdul-Mattalib explained to her his
Mory about the vow, she asked them to leave her until the spirit visited her
as she would consult with him. Leaving her. "Abdul-Muttalib supplicated to
Allah. The next day she said, "The answer has come to me. How much is
the blood-money amang you?" They said, "Ten camels.” She told them to
g0 back to their country, offer the young man and ten camels as sacrifice,
and then cast the lots for them and for him. If the man's arrow were to come
‘out, they would add ten more camels, until their god is satisfied. However,



<br><br><br>

if the camels’ arrow were to come out, they would be staughtered instead of
“Abdullah, as their god would be satisfied and their man would he rescued.

Returning to Makkah, they agreed to do as they had been advised.
*Abdul-Mujalib was continually supplicating to Allah. They brought
‘Abdullah and ten camels, while “Abdul-Muualib stood by Hubull praying to
Allah. Then they cast lots and the “Abdullah's arrow came forth. They added
ten more camels, becoming twenty. They cast lots again and again, and each
time “Abdullah's arrow came out, “Abdul-Muttalib supplicated to Allah, and
they added ten camels until they reached a hundred. Only then did the lots
fall against the camels. The Quraysh and those attending said, "At last your
god is satisfied, “Abdal-Muttalib.” It was said that “Abdul-Muttalib said,
“No by Allah, not until | cast lots three times for them.” They did and each
time the arrow fell against the camels, which were slaughtered, and left
there, and no human was prevented to eat

What was Said to Aminah
when She had Conceived the Prophet (pbuh)

People, and only Allah knows best, that Aminah daughter of Wahb, the
mother of the Messenger ‘of Allah (pbuh), used to say when she was
pregnant with the Messenger of Allah, that it was said to her (in a vision),
“You are conceiving the master of this nation and when he has been born
say, ‘T Seek refuge for him with the One from the evil of every envious
person’, then name him Muhammad")

And, when she became pregnant with him, she saw in a dream that
light emited forth from her by which she could see the castles of Busta in
Syria. After a short while “Abdullih, the Prophet's father died, while his
mother was still pregnant.

The Birth of the Messenger of Allah (pbuh)

‘The Prophet (pbuh) was born on Monday 12th RabF'ul-Awwal in the
‘Year of the Elephant. Qays ibn Makhramah said. “I and the Prophet (pbuh)
were bor in the Year of the Elephant.” Hassan ibn Thabit said, "By Allah, 1
was a well-grown boy: of seven or eight, understanding all that I heard,
when I heard a Jew yelling out raising his voice as much as he could from
the top of a fort in Yathrib, “O Jews” until they all gathered and said, “Woe
to you, what has happened?” He replied, “Tonight has shined a star wi
which Ahmad is to be bor.”

When the Prophet's mother delivered him, she sent to his grandfather,
*Abdul-Muttalib, to inform him about the binh of a boy, asking him to come
and look ut him. After seeing him, sbe told him about what she had seen
when she was pregnant with him, what was said to her and what she was
asked to name him. It is alleged that “Abdul-Muttalib took him to the
Ka'bah where he prayed and praised Allah thanking Him for His gift. Then
he brought him out and gave him to his mother, searching for wet nurses for
him, A woman from Band Sad ibn Bakr called Halimah daughter of Aba
Dhw'ayb, was chosen as a wet nurse.

Halimah

Halimah narrated that she left her dwelling with her hushand and a
suckling son, accompanying some women of her clan, in quest of other
babies to suckle:

“It was a year of famine and drought and we were destitute. 1 rode my
greenish she-donkey. There was with us an old she-camel which did not
yield even a drop of milk. We could not have a wink of sleep the whole
night because of the weeping of my hungry baby. There was not enough
milk in my breasts, nor could the she-camel feed him, We constantly hoped
for rain and immediate relief. Riding my she-donkey it lagged bebind
because of its weakness and malnutrition, so that it was a hardship for other
riders. When we reached Makkah, we looked for children to suckle, and the
Messenger of Allah was offered to each woman of us who refused him

<br><br><br>

saying that he was an orphan. ‘That was because we hoped for a good reward
from the child's father. We said, “An orphan! and what can his mother and
grandfather do?” We disdained because of that, Every woman who came
with me got a suckling child except me. Before departure, I ssid to my
husband, “By Allah, I hate to return among my friends without a suckling
baby: I will go and take that orphan.” He said, "No harm on you if you did;
Perhaps Allah will bless us through this orphan.” So T went and (ook him
because there was no other alternative but to take him. On my way back. as
soon as T put him in my lap, my breasts overflowed with milk, which he
drank to his heart's content, and so did his foster brother. Then both of them
slept, while before this we could not sleep because of my son's erying. My
hushand went to the old she-camel to milk it; to his surprise its udders were
full; he milked it and we drank of its milk until we were completely
satisfied, and we spent a good night. In the morning my husband said, ‘Do
you know Halimah that you have taken a blessed child?’ I said, “By Alla, 1
hope so."

T carried him with me, as we rode back on my she-donkey, and it went at
such a speed that other donkeys could not catch up to it, so that my fellow
travelers said to me, Woe daughter of Ab0 Dinu‘ayb! Stop and wait for us. Is
this not the she-donkey on which you had come with?’ ‘Sure it is’ T said.
‘They replied, ‘By Allah, there is something unusual.’ Then we reached our
dwellings in Band Sa’d land, which I had never known a land as barren as it was,

Having him with us, my flock yielded milk abundantly. We milked them
and drank at the time when no one cout have & drop of milk, nor find
anything in their animals’ udders. People around us were saying to their
shepherds. ‘Woe to you! Let your sheep graze where the daughter of Abi
Dhulayb’s shepherd goes” Still, their flocks returned hungry without even a
drop of milk, while mine had milk in abundance. We continued to recognize
that this grace was from Allah, until two years had passed, when | weaned
him. He was growing up more than any other child did, so by the time he
wwas two he was a strong child. We took him back to his mother, though we
were keen to keep him with us because of the blessing and fortune whict he
brought us. 1 suid 1 her, ‘Would you leave my little boy with me until he
becomes bigger. for I am afraid of the epidemic of Makkah which might
infect him.’ We persisted until she let him go with us.

<br><br><br>

By Allah, ufter few months of our return, he and his brother were with
‘our lambs behind our dwellings when his brother came running to us, Two
men in white have seized my Qurayshi brother und thrown him down and
ripped opened his chest, and are moving it up’ We ran towards him and
found him standing up with a pale face. We embraced him, asking him what
had happened. He said, ‘Two men in white garments came, laid me down
and ripped open my chest, looking for something which 1 do not know.’ So
‘we took him back to our tent.

His (foster) father said to me, 'Halima, 1 am afraid that this child has
had a stroke, so we should retum him to his family before anything appears
on him.’ Thus we carried him to his mother who wondered. ‘Why did you
bring him while you were insisting to let him stay with you?’ I said to het,
“Allah has let my son grow o this age-and I have done my duty. | am afraid
that any harm will befall him, so E have brought him back to you as you
‘wished.’ She felt that this was not the matter and she insisted to know the
truth until I told her what had happened. She said. ‘Do you fear a demon
possesses him? I replied that I did. She said that demon had no control over
her son who had a great future before him. Then she told how when she was
pregnant with him a light went out from her which reached the castles of
Busta in Syria, and that she had bor him with the least difficulty
imaginable. When she delivered him he put his hands on the ground raising
his head towards the heavens, ‘Leave him then and go in peace,’ said she."

The Opening of the Prophet's (pbuh) Chest

Yon Ishaq said, "Thawr ibn Yazid told me, on the authority of a
knowledgeable person whom I believe is Khalid ibm Ma’diin al-Kald, that
some of the Prophet's (pbuh) Companions asked him to tell them about
himself. He (pbuh) said.

if you weighed him against his entire nation he would outweigh them.

Under the Custody of his Grandfather

‘The Prophet (pbuh) lived with his mother Aminah the daughter of Wahb
and his grandfather “Abdul-Muttalib in Allah's care and guardianship,
growing like @ good plant, as Allah had honored him, When he was six
years old his mother Aminah died at Abwi’, a place between Makkah and
Madinah, when she took him to visit his matemal uncles of Band *Adiyy ibn
an-Najide, She died on her return to Makkah, Thus the Prophet (pbuh) was
left to his grandfather, who had a bed in the shade of the Kabah, His sons
sal around the bed, but none of them sat on it, out of respect for him, The
Prophet (pbuh), being still a young boy would sit on it and his uncles would
drive him away. When “Abdul-Muttalib saw this he said, "Let my son alone,
for by Allah he has a great future.” Then he would make him sit beside him
‘on his bed and would wipe his back with his hand. It used to please him to
see what he did, When the Prophet (pbuh) was eight years old, his
‘grandfather died, That was eight years after the Year of the Elephant,

Under the Custody of his Uncle

After the death of ~Abdul-Muttalib, the Prophet (pbuh) lived with his
Unele Aba Talib. There was a man of Lihb who was a seer and whenever he
‘came to Makkah, the Qurayshi men brought their boys for him to look at
and to tell their fortunes. Abii Talib also brought the Prophet (pbuh) who
‘was still at that time a boy. The seer looked at him and then he became

a


<br><br><br>

preoccupied with something. When he finished he said, “Bring me that
hoy.” When Aba Talib saw his enthusiasm he concealed him and the seer
began to say, "Woe to you, bring me the boy I have just seen, for by Allah
the has a great future.”

The Story of Bahira

Abd Talib was going by caravan to Syria as a trader. While preparing for
his departure, the Messenger of Allah attached himself closely to his uncle,
so that he compassionately decided to take him along, saying "By Allah I
will take him with me and we will never separate.” Reaching Busta in Syria,
there was a monk called Babfra staying in a hermitage, He was well versed
in Christianity, It was alleged that this monk had always lived in that
hermitage where he gained his knowledge from a book handed down from
generation to generation. That year when they settled near Babird it was,
unlike provious years, when he never spoke to them nor even noticed them,
hhe made a great feast for them. This was because, as it was alleged, he had
seen something while in his hermitage. They said that while he was in his
hermitage he recognized the Prophet of Allah in the caravan when they were
approaching, with a cloud overshadowing him among the peaple. Then they
came anel sat in the shadow of a tree near the monk. He found the cloud
overshadowing the tree, and its branches were bending and drooping over
the Prophet (pbuh) until he was in the shadow under it, When Babiri saw
that, he left his hermitage. He sent to them saying, "I have prepared food for
you, O men of Quraysh and I would like you all to come, both the old and
the young, bondmen and freemen.” One of them said, “By Allah, Baird!
‘Something unusual has happened to you today, you have never treated us
like that before, as we have often passed by you .What has occurred to you
today?” He replied. “You are right in what you say, but you are guests and 1
wish to be generous t0 you by offering food that you all may eat." Thus,
they grouped together, and went (0 him, leaving the Prophet (pbuh), thei
youngest, behind with the baggage under the tree. Looking at the people,
Bahira did not see the sign which he knew about, so he said, "O people of
Quraysh do not let any of you not attend my feast." They told him that
everyone had come except for-a boy, who was the youngest of them, so they

kept him with their baggage, Here he said. “Invite him to join you in this
meal.” Among them a Qurayshi said. "By ALLit and Al Uzzi, we are to
blame for leaving the son of “Absdullah ibn * Abdul-Muwtalit”

‘Then he brought him, embraced him, and made him sit with the people.
When Babird saw him, he observed him carefully, watching his body to find
traces of his description (in the Christian books). After eating. the people
dispersed and Babjir went to him saying. "Boy, 1 ask you by AlLt and
Al’ Uzzi to answer me what 1 am going to ask you.” Babitd said so only
hhecause he had heard the people of this boy swearing by these idols. It was
said that the Prophet (pbuh) said to him, "Do not ask me by Al-LSt and
Al-Uzzi, for by Allah 1 detest nothing more than these two." Babira
replied, "Then by Allah tell me what Fask you." He said, "Ask me whatever
you like.” So he began to ask him about his sleep, appearance, and affairs in
general. The Prophet's (pbuh) answers coincided with what Babird knew of
his description. Then he looked at his back and found the seal of
prophethood between his shoulders in the very place described in his book.
Afterwards he went to his unele Abd lib asking, "What is the relationship
between you and this bay?” He said, "He is my son.” Babi said, "No, he is
‘Hot your son. The father of this boy should not be alive.” "He is my brother's
son,” he said. When he asked where his father was, he told him that he died,
when his mother had been pregnant with him. “That is true,” said Babira,
"Go back with your brother's son to his country and protect him cautiously
against the Jews, for, by Allah, if they knew about him. what I know, they
will contrive evil against him, Great things are in store for your nephew. sa
promptly take him home.”

His Marriage to Khadijah

(may Allah be pleased with her)

Khadijah was a trade woman of honor and wealth. She used to hire men
to carry out her trade based on profit-sharing, as the Quraysh were a people
‘of commerce. When she heard about the Prophet's truthfulness, honesty, and
honorable behavior, she sent for him proposing a deal that he would carry
out her trade in Syria, while she would pay him more than any other she had
paid before, He was to be accompanied by a lad of hers called Maysarah.
‘The Messenger of Allal accepted the deal, and the two went out until they
reached Syria.

‘The Prophet (pbuh) sat under the shade of « tree near a monk's cell. The
monk went o Maysarah asking "Who is that man under the tree?” Maysarah
answered, "He is of the Quraysh, from the people of the Haram.” The monk
said, "None but a Prophet ever sat under this tree!"

‘Then the Prophet (pbuh), after selling the goods and buying whatever he
wanted to buy. started the joumney back to Makkah. At the height of noon
when the heat was intense, as he rode his camel, Maysarah saw two angles:
shading the Prophet (pbuh) from the sun's beam. In Makkah he gave
Khadijah her property which she afterwards sold with double its value or
thereabouts,

Maysarah told her about the words of the monk and how the two angles
shaded him, Khadijah was a decisive, intelligent, and noble woman
possessing the bounties with which Allah willed to. honor her. Once
Maysarah told her these things, she sent to the Prophet (pbuh) as she said,
*O cousin T like you because of your relationship and your high reputation
among your people, honesty, good manners, and truthfulness.” Then she
proposed marriage. Khadijah was then the most honorable, richest woman
and of the best family backgrounds in the Quraysh. All her people were

<br><br><br>

keen to marty her if it were possible, The Prophet (pbuh) told his uncles
about Khadijah's proposal, and his uncle Hamaah went with him to
Khuwaylid ibn Asad for proposal and he married her." She was the mother
of all the Prophet's children except Ibrahim. These children are Al-Qasim,
which was part of a sumame by which the Prophet was called, “Abdullah”,
Zaynab, Rugayyah, Umm Kulthom, and Fatimah, peace be upon them all

Al-Qasim and “Abdullah died in the pre-Islam time, while the Prophet's
daughters embraced Islam and migrated with him to Madinah.

Waraqah ibn Nawfal

Khadijah went to her (paternal) cousin Waragah ibn Nawtal ibn Asad
ibn “Abdel-"Uzzi, who was Christian who had studied the Scriptures and
was knowledgeable, She narrated to him what her lad Maysarah had told her
about the monk's words and how he saw the two angels shading him.
Waragah said, “If this is true, Khadijah, verily Muhammad is the Prophet of
this nation, | know that a Prophet is expected to appear in this nation and in
this era.” Waragah felt that the matter was too slow and used to say, "How
long?”

The Rebuilding of the Ka* bah

The Prophet (pbuh) was thiny-five years of age when the Quraysh
agreed 10 rebuild the Kabab, by roofing it but they feared destroying it,
since it was made of white stones.

A shipwreck of « Roman merchant ship was found ashore in Jiddah,
‘They took its timber to prepare it for roofing the Ka'bah, There was a
Coptic carpenter in Makkah, so they felt that everything was ready for
restoration, A snake used to come out of the Ka'bah well in which the
dedicated things were thrown. The snake used to encroach everyday on the

“approached it, it raised its head, mace a rustling noise and opened its mouth
‘One day while it was sunning itself, Allah sent a bird, which captured it and
flew away. At that, the Quraysh said, "We hope that Allah 1s pleased with
what we intend to do; we have a worker who is a friend of ours. We have
the timber and Allah has saved us from the snake.” When they had decided
to knock it down and rebuild it, Abii Wahb iba “Amr ibn “A'idh ibn “Abd
ibn “Imran ibn Makhzdm took a stone from the Kabah but it swept out of
his hands and returned to its place. He said. "O Quraysh, do not jet into this
building anything bur lawful gains: so no harloty, rida, nor unjust
practices,”

Afterwards, the Quraysh divided labor between themselves; the section
near the gate was appointed to Band “Abd Mandf and Zuhrah, the section
between the Black Stone comer and the Yemeni corner was to Band
Makhziim and the Qurayshi tribes joined them, the back of the Ka’ bah was:

While people were anxious about demolishing the temple, und retreated

a mattock, and went up to it saying, "O Allah, we have not disbelieved (in
your religion). O Allah, we only want 10 do good.” Then he destroyed the
part between the two comers. That night people were watching out. saying,
"We will wait and sce; if he is injured we will not demolish any of it and
will keep it as it was; but if nothing happens to him then Allah is satisfied
with what we are doing and we will desteoy it.” In the moraing AL-Walid
was working and the people with him. When they reactied the foundation of
Ibrahim (pbuh), they found green stones like camel's humnps joined together.

‘The Qurayshi tribes kept on gathering Stones for the building, each tribe
fon its own, The building was erected up to the Black Stone, where
disagreements emerged: each tribe wanted to lift it alone to its pisce, until
they made alliances, and prepared to fight.

A narrator said that Abi Umayyah ibnul-Mughirah, then the eldest of
the Quraysh, said, "O Quraysh, let the first man to enter the gate of this
mosque arbitrate in your dispute.” They agreed. The first one to enter was

the Messenger of Allah (pbuh). On seeing him, they said, "It is the
Trustworthy (Al-Amiin), we are satisfied! It is Muhammad." When he
reached them and they told him the story, he said, "Give me a mantle.” They
brought one, which he (spread on the ground and) placed the stone on. He
then said. “Let (the head of) every tribe hold a side of the mantle and lift it
up all together.” When they got it into position he placed it with his own
hands, and then the building continued above it.

Reports of Arab Diviners, Jewish Rabbis,
and Christian Monks

Jewish rabbis, Christian monks, and Arab diviners had discussed the
subject of the Messenger of Allah (pbuh) before his advent when his time
was coming closer. The rabbis and monks knew about him from their
Prophets and what had been written in their Scriptures describing him. The
Arab diviners knew about him from Satans reporting what they had secretly
‘overheard when they were not hindered from hearing by being thrown with
stars. Diviners, male and female, comtinued to raise some of these issues
which the Arabs were not attentive to, until Allah sent him. then the things
which they had mentioned occurred and they recognized them. When the
Prophet's coming was getting nearer and his mission was about to begin,
Satans were prevented to listen and they could not occupy the seats in which
they used to sit 10 overhear the heavenly tidings, as they were hurled with
stars, The jinn knew that it was a Divine occurrence from Allah's rule over
people.

between his shoulders was also muscular. The line of hair between his neck
and chest was thin and fine. His palms and feet were strong, He used to
walk firmly and straightly. and he used o turn around altogether with his
whole body. Between his shoulders there was the seal of prophethood; and,
the (pbuh) is the seal of all Prophets. He was of all mankind the most

with, and the most hospitable to accompany. Whoever saw him for the first
time venerated him, and whoever mixed with him loved him. Then his

The Description of the Messenger of Allah
(pbuh) in the Gospel

Ibn Ishiiq said. "Among things which reached me about that which had
been revealed to “isa the Son of Mary in the Gospel, for his followers,
describing the Messenger of Allah (pbuh), according to Yubannas the
Apostle when he inscribed the Gospel for them from the Testament of “Isa
the Son of Mary, concerning the Messenger of Allah (pbuh), that he said,
“He who hates me hates the Lord. Except for that I had done in their
presence things that no one had done before me. they would have not had a
sin, However now they are discontented and think that they will overcome
me as well as the Lord, but the word in the Revelation must be done. They
hated me falsely. But when the Manhamanni who Allah will send to you
and who is a sacred spirit from the Lord, comes, he will be a witness of me
and you also because you were with me in the past. {am telling you about
this not to have any doubt."

THE MISSION
AND DA*WAH TO ISLAM
UNTIL THE EMIGRATION



<br><br><br>

The Mission

When Muhammad, the Prophet of Allah, (pbuh) became forty years old,
Allah sent him as a merey to the worlds and bearer of good tidings to
mankind, Allah had made a compact with every Prophet, whom He had sent
before him that he should believe in Him, verify Him and vindicate Him
against whoever disagreed with Him. He required of them that they should
convey this to everyone who believed in them, and they all carried out their
commitment in this regard

According to “Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her), "When Allah
wanted to honor Muhammad (pbuh) and have mercy on His servants
through him, the first sign of prophethood to the Prophet (pbuh) was true
visions. Whenever he saw a vision while sleeping it tumed to be strikingly
true, like the brightness of daybreak. And Allah made him love solitude so
that he liked nothing more than to be alone."

“Abdul-Malik ibn “Ubaydillih reported that the Prophet (pbuh), at the
time when Allah wanted to bestow His grace upon him and begin (the state
of) prophethood, would head out for his purpose and go as far as the
‘mountain passes of Makkah and the beds of its valleys where no house was
seen. There was not a stone nor a tree that he passed by, but would say,
“Peace be upon you, O Messenger of Allah”. The Prophet (pbuh) would
turn to his right, left and behind him and would find no more than trees and.
stones. Thus he kept on seeing and hearing such things so long as Allah
willed. Then Jibril (peace be upon him) came to him with Allah's grace
while he was in Hiri” in the month of Ramadan.

According to “Ubayd ibn “Umayr, the Prophet of Allah (pbuh) used to
stay in privacy in Hiri’ every year for a month to practice tahannuth
(worship and devotion away from idols); a religious state known in Quraysh
in the pre-Islamic period. Every year during that month the Prophet (pbuh)
would worship in privacy and give food to the indigent who came to him,

1A mouniala tee miles away from Makkat

—S—


<br><br><br>

At the endl of the month, the first thing he used to do before returning home
was (0 go to the Ka’bah and circumambulate seven times or as often as
Allah wished: then he would return to his house. In the month of Ramadan,
in which Allah willed to honor him with the Mission, the Prophet (pbuh)
‘went to Hiri! as was usual to him, and his family was with him, When it was
the night on which Allah honored him with His Message, Jibril came to him
with the command of Allah. The Prophet (pbub) said,

“ibrit came to me while I was asleep in a covertet of brocade wherean
was something written, and said, ‘Read! I said, “Ido not read.’ He wok
‘me anid squeezed me so vehemently that I thought it was death: then he

squeezed me so vehemently that U thought it was death; then he let me go
‘and said. Read!" I said, ‘What shall 1 read” He took me and squeezed
‘me so vehemently that I thought it was death; then he said, ‘Read!" 1
suid, ‘What (then) shall 1 read?" He said,

created man from a clot (a piece of thick coagulated blowd). Reud! And
your Lord ix the Most Generous, Who has taught (the writing) by the

(A Alag: 1-5)

So read, and he left me. When I got up from niy sleep, it was as if these
words were firmly writen in my heart. When I went out midway on the
‘mountain, I heard a voice from the sky saying, ‘O Muhammad! You are
the Messenger of Allah and lam Jibril."I raised my head up to the sky to
see (who was speaking) and it was Jibrit in the form of a man with feet
astride the horizon, saving. ‘0 Muhammad? You are the Messenger of

turned to me.’ Then I apprised her of what Ua seen; and she said ‘Re-
Joie, O cousin ana be firm. Surely, by Him in Whose Hand is Khadijah's
soul, | hopefully think that you will be the Prophet of this nation.’ "

‘Then she put on (suitable) clothes and went out to her (paternal) cousin,
Waragah ibn Nasefal who had become a Christian, and who read books and
listened from those of the Torah and the Gospel. She informed him about
what the Prophet (pbuh) had told her of what he had seen and heard.
Waragah cried. “Holy! Holy! Surely. by Him in Whose Hand is Waragah's
soul, if you are telling me the truth, © Khadijah, there has come to him the
greatest Namas (i.e. Jibril) who came Miisi before, and be is the Prophet of
this nation. Tell him to be firm.”

Khadijah returned to the Prophet (pbuh) and told him what Waragah had
said. When the Prophet (pbuh) had completed the period of solitude. he did
as he was accustomed to do in Makkah, While there, Waraqah met him and
suid, "O my brother's son, tell me what you have seen and heard.” After
telling him, he said to the Prophet (pbuh), “Surely, by Him in Whose Hand
is Waragab’s soul, you are the Prophet of this nation. There has come to the
‘greatest Naas, who came to Masa. Surely, you will be called a liar, you
will be hurt, driven out, and fought! If were ative that day, I would support
(the religion of) Alluh to a victory such that He knows.” Then he leaned
near bim and kissed his forehead; then the Prophet (pbuh) returned home.

message. Through her. Allah relieved burdens that afflicted His Prophet

falsifying him which saddened him, but Allah comforted him with her when
he returned hore, She reinforced him, alleviated his burden, certified his
truth, and belittled men's opposition. May Allah Almighty have merey upon
her! The Prophet (pbuh) said,

“Lwas commanded to give Khadijah the good tidings of « house made of

carved pearls wherein will be no aoise, nor drudgery.”

The Pause in Revelation

Revelation paused for a while so that the Prophet (pbuh) became
disturbed and depressed. Then Jibril came with Siar Ad-Duled, in which his
Lord, who had honored him, swore that He had neither forsaken. him nor
hated him. Allah the Almighty says,

¢ By the forenoon (after sun-rise); and by the night when it is still (or
darkens); your Lord (O Muhammad) has neither forsaken you nor hated
youu

That is, | have not abandoned you. nor hated you after loving you.

Anu! indeed the Hereafter is better for vou than the present (life of this
world.»
‘That is, What T have for you, on your retum to Me, is much better than
‘the honor that I have provided you in the mundane world,
And verily, your Lord will give you (all Le. good) so that you shall be
well-pleased. }
That is, of victory in this mundane world and recompense in the
Hereafter.
4 Did He not find you (0 Muhammad) an orphan and gave you a ref.
tuge? And He found you unaware (of the Quritn. its legal laws, and Pro-
phethood, etc.) and guided Nou? And He found you poor, and made you
rich (self-sufficient with self-contentment, et)?

Allah hence reminds him of how He bestowed him with His honor and
kindness as carly as he was orphan, poor and unguided, as He saved him

from all that out of His mercy.



<br><br><br>

Therefore. treat not the orphan with oppression, and repulse not the
beggar.

‘That is, do not be an oppressor or boastful, or harsh and stern towards the
weak servants of Allah.

¢ And proclaim the Grace of your Lord. »

That is, talk about the Grace and Providence of Allah and the honor of
prophethood. and call people to it.

‘Therefore, the Prophet (pbuh) began to proclaim secretly Allah's Grace
to him and His servants through prophethood, to anyone of his people
whom he could trust.

The First to Embrace Islam

‘The first male to believe in the Messenger of Allah (pbuh), offer prayers
with him, and to verify in his divine message was “Ali ibn Abi Talib, who
was then ten yeurs old. It was Allah's favor and grace on “Ali that the
Quraysh was exposed to a severe crisis. Seeing that Aba Talib had many
children, the Prophet (pbuh) told his uncle, Al-Abbas, who was one of the
richest of Band Hashim, “O “Abbas, your brother Aba Talib has many.
children and as you see crisis prevails, so let us go together and (offer to)
alleviate the burden of his children so each of us takes one of his sons."
Al Abbas agreed, They went to AbG Talib telling him that they wanted to,
lessen the responsibility of his children until the end of the crisis, AbO Talib,
said. "Do what you like so long as you leave me ‘ Agil.” So the Prophet took
~All and Al- Abbas took Ja‘far. “AIT remained with the Messenger (pbuh)
until Allah sent him forth as a Prophet. “Ali followed him, believed him, and
Verified bis truth,

Some scholars mentioned that when the time of prayers came the
Prophet (pbuh) used to go out to the mountain passes of Makkah
accompanied by “Ali, who went disguised from his father. uncles, and the
rest of his people. There they used to offer prayer until nightfall. This
continued until one day Abd Talib came upon them while they were
offering prayer, and said to the Prophet (pbuh), "O my brother's son, what is
this religion which I see you following?” He answered, "O uncle, this is the



<br><br><br>

yeligion of Allah, His angels, and His Messengers, and the religion of our
father Ibrahim. Allah has sent me as a Messenger to (His) servants, and you,
my uncle, most deserve that Tshould advise you and call you to guidance,
and you are the most worthy tw respond to me and help me.” His uncle
replied, “I cannot forsake the religion of my ancestors which they followed,
but by Allah you shall never meet with anything to afflict you so long as 1
live.”

Afterwards, Zayd ibn Hérithah ibn Shurabbil ibn Kab ibn * Abdel“ Uzza
became a Muslim, Hakim ibn Hizim ibn Khuwaylid came from Syria with
slaves among which was Zayd iba Harithah. His paternal aunt, Khadijah
who was then wife of the Prophet (pbuh) visited him. He asked her to
‘choose any the slaves, so she chose Zayd. When the Prophet (pbuh) saw
him, he asked her to dedicate Zayd to him. She did so and he freed him and
then adopted him. That was before the revelation, Then Aba Bakr ibn Abi
Quluifah whose name was “Atiq embraced Islam, AbO Qubéfah’s name was
“Uthman, When he became a Muslim, he declared his Islam openly and
called others to Allah and to His Messenger. He was a sociable, easy and
well-liked man among his people. He knew more about the good and bad of
Quraysh than anyone else. He was a merchant of high morals and kindness.
His people used to go to him seeking his advice in many matters because of
his wide knowledge, his experience in commerce. and his sociable nature.
He began (o call to Allah and to fslam, all whoever he had confidence in, of
those who used to come to him and sit with him.

‘Those who accepted Islam through Aba Bakr were: “Uthman ibn “Affin,

The Prophet's Public Preaching
and the Reaction to it

People embraced Islam in large groups of both men and women until
tlk about Islam prevailed in Makkah. Then Allah commanded His
Messenger to publicize what he had received and to call people to Allah's
commands. After three years of secret preaching, Allah commanded him to
declare the religion. Allah the Almighty says,

& Therefore proclaim openly (Allah's Message, Islamic Monotheism)

that which you are commanded, andl turn away from Al-Mushrikiin (pot-
theists, idolaters, and disbelievers, etc, - see V.2: 105).}

‘am innocent af what you do.”
(Ash-Shw ard’: 214-216)
When the Prophet's Companions wanted to offer prayers, they used 10 go
to the mountain passes of Makkah so as to conceal their prayers from their
people. One day while Sa'd iba Abi Waqqs was offering prayer among a
‘group of the Prophet's (pbuh) Companions in the mountain passes, a band of
the polytheists earme upon them, rudely interrupting them, mocking at them
for their prayers until it came to blows. Sa'd smote a polytheist wit
jawbone of a camel and hurt him. ‘This was the first bloodshed in Islam.

When the Prophet (pbuh) explicitly professed Islam as Allah had
commanded him, his people did not forsake or tum against him until he
criticized their gods and idols, When hie did, they gathered in denial,
considering him an enemy, all except a despised minority whom Allah the
Almighty had protected by Islam. The Prophet's uncle, Abi Talib was kind
to him and supported him.

When the Quraysh discovered that he would not give up, yet he
withdrew from them and scorned their idols, as well as the fact that his
uncle supported him and would not let them reach him, some of their nobles
went to Abdi Talib and said, "O Aba Tilib, your nephew has insulted our
gods, scomed our religion, demeaned our life style and accused our
ancestors of misguidance; either you must stop him or you must let us get
hhim, for you yourself are in the same position as we are in opposition to him
‘and we will rid you of him.” He gave them a polite reply and a soft answer
so they left him.

‘The Prophet (pbuh) continued on his way, preaching Allah’s religion and
calling men hitherto, As a result, his relations with the Quraysh were getting
worse and men withdrew in hostility. They were preoccupied with his affai
stirring up one another against him. Then they spoke to Abi Talib for a
second time and said, "O Abd Talib, you have a high and noble position
among us, and we have requested you to cease your nephew's acts but you

—G—


<br><br><br>

have not done so. By Allah, we cannot bear that our forefathers be reviled,
our customs mocked, and our gods insulted. Until you rid us of him we will
fight both of you until one side perishes”.

Abu Tali sent for the Prophet (pbuh) and said, “O nephew, your people
have said so and so, Spare me and yourself, Do not make me endure more
than Tan”, The Prophet (pbuh) thought that his uncle had changed his mind
and would abandon him, and had become short of supporting him. He
answered, “O my uncle, by Allah. if they put the sun in my right hand and
the moon in my left on condition that 1 abandon this matter (i.e. Islam), until
Alluh has made it triumphant, or I perish therein, T would not abandon
Then the Prophet (pbuh) wept and stood up. As he turned away his uncle
called him and said, "Come back, my nephew,” and when he came back, he
said, "Go and say whatever you like, for by Allah I will never give you up”

When the Quraysh perceived that AbO Talib had refused to give the
Prophet (pbuh) to them, and that he was determined to part company with
them, they went to him with “Imirah ibnul-Walid and said, “O Abi Talib,
this is “Imarah, the mightiest and most handsome young man among the
Quraysh, so take him and you will have the benefit of his intelligence and
support; adopt him as a son and give us your nephew, who has gone against
your religion and the religion of your ancestors, disjoined the unity of your
people, ridiculed our life style, so that we may kill him. This will be man for
man.” He replied, "By Allah, this is an evil bargain, would you give me
your son to feed him for you, and I give you my son in return to kill him?
By Allah, this shall never be.” Al-Mut'im ibn “Adiyy said. "Your people
have been fair with you, taking pains to abstain from what you dislike. I see
that you do not want to accept anything from them.” Abd Talib said, “By
Allah, they have not treated me with justice, you have approved of betraying.
‘me and helping the people against me, so do whatever you like.” So
conditions deteriorated, the fighting became fiery and people were split up.
and clearly displayed their enmity to their opponents.

Then the Quraysh incited people against the Companions of the Prophet
(pbuh) who had become Muslims. Every tribe fell upon the Muslims among
them, beating them and enticing them from their religion. Allah protected
His Messenger from them through his uncle who, when he saw what the

Quraysh were doing to Bani Hashim and Band Al-Mattalib, he invited them
to stand with him in protecting the Prophet (pbuh). They agreed to do so,
except Abii Lahab, the accursed enemy of Allah,

The Words of Al-Walid ibnul-Mughirah
about the Qur'an

When the season of pilgrimage was due, a number of the Quraysh went
to Al-Walid ibnul-Mughirah, who was a man of some standing among them.
He addressed them saying: "O Quraysh, here is the season of pilgrimage and
deputations of the Arabs will come to you and they will have heard about
this fellow of yours, so agree upon @ unanimous resolution that could enjoy
the approval of them all without dispute, so that none will belie the other.”
They replied, “Give us your opinion about him.” He said, "No you talk and I
will listen.” They said, "He is a soothsayer". He said, "By Allah, he is not
that, for he has not the murmuring and rhyming of soothsayer’s speech.”
Then he is possessed by Jinn." They said. "No, he is not that.” He said.
“We have seen possessed ones, and no insinuations peculiar to that state of
mind were detected." “Then he is a poet,” They said. "No he is not a poet,
for we know poetry in all its forms and metres.” "Then he is practicing
witchcraft.” They said. "No, we have seen sorcerers and their witchcraft and
he has never been involved in the practice of blowing on the knots.” He
said. "Then what are we to say, O Aba “Abd Shams?" They asked. "By
Allah, his words are sweet. well based, and fruitful. and all what you are
repeating about him is established to be false. Yet, the most proper thing
you can say about him is that he is a magician who has brought magic
‘words with which he separates between brothers, spouses, and families.” He
said. At this point they left him, and began to sit on the roads which men
take when they come to the fair. They warned everyone who passed by them.
about Muhammad's deeds, Then Allah the Almighty revealed concerning
Al Walid,

é Leave Me Alone (10 deal) with whom I created Alone (without any

Nay! Verily, he has been stubborn and opposing Our Aydt (proofs, ev-
iddences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.)

(AF-Muddaththir: 11-16)

So these men began to spread this report about the Prophet (pbuh) to
whoever they met so that the Arabs left that fair knowing about the Prophet
(pbuh), and his reputation was then spread throughout the whole of Arabia,

How the Prophet (pbuh)
was Treated by his People

‘When the Quraysh became disturbed by the troubles triggering enmity
between them and the Prophet (pbuh) and the Muslims, they incited against
him foolish men who called him a liar, hurt him, and accused him of being a
poet, sorcerer, a diviner, and of being possessed. However, the Prophet
(pbuh) continued to proclaim what Allah had ordained him to profess,
concealing nothing, and exciting their dislike by condemning their religion,
withdrawing from their idols, and abandoning them for their disbelief.

they had endured from this fellow; he had ridiculed their way of life, and
cursed the idols they had taken as gods. They also said that what they had
borne was exceeded all bearing. While they were thus discussing him, the
Prophet (pbuh) approached them and kissed the Black Stone, then he passed.

with words. I observed this on the face of the Messenger of Allah (pbul).
He went on and as he passed by them the second time they repeated the
same thing, Again 1 observed this on the face of the Messenger of Allah
(pbuh). Then he passed the third time, and they did the same, He stopped
and said, "Will you listen to me, O Quraysh? By Him in Whose hand is my
soul, U have brought you slaughter (i.e. destruction, if you do not believe).”
This word so thrilled the people that all of them stood silent and still; even

<br><br><br>

those who had hitherto been most violent, spoke to him in the kindest way:
possible saying, "Go, O Abul-Qasim, for by Alish you have never been
ignorant." The Prophet (pbuh) went away, and in the morning they gathered
in the Hijr. Twas there too, and they reminded each other of what had taken
place between them and the Prophet (pbulh) and how they left him alone
when he displayed something unpleasant. While they were there talking, the
Prophet (pbuh) showed up, and they leaped upon him as one man and
encircled him, saying, "Are you the one who says so-and-so against our
gods and our religion?” The Prophet (pbuh) said, “Yes, fam the one who
says that.” 1 saw one of them seizing his clothes. Then Abd Bakr interposed
himself weeping and saying. "Would you kill a man for saying Allah is his
Lord?” Then they left him. That is the worst thing that I ever saw the
Quraysh doing to him.”

Hamzah Accepts Islam

A man of Aslam, who had a good memory, told me that Aba Jahl passed
by the Prophet (pbuh) at As-Safa and injured him, maliciously offending
his religion and trying to ridicule his cause, The Prophet (pbuh) did not
speak to him. During this. a mawldh of “Abdullah ibn Jud°an was in her
house listening to what was going on. Then he left him and went to an
assembly of the Quraysh at the Karbah and sat there, After a little while,
Hanwzah ibn “Abdel-Muuilib approached, with his bow hanging on his
shoulder back from the hunt, for he was fond of hunting and used to go out
shooting. Whenever he returned from a chase he used to salute every
assembly of the Quraysh he met and stop to speak with them. He was the
dearest and strongest man of the Quraysh. (At that time the Prophet (pbuh)
had gone home.) Hamzah passed by this mawiah, who asked him, “O Abi
Imdrah, have you not heard of what Abul-Eakam'” ibn Hisham has just
done a short while ago to your nephew, Muhammad? He had found him
silting there. so he injured and insulted him. and treated him badly, whereas.
Muhammad did not utter « word.” Hamzah was enraged, for Allah wanted

to honor him, so he went out at # run and did not stop to greet anyone,
intending to quarre! with Abd Jahl when he met him. When he centered the
mosque he saw him sitting among the people, and went up to him until he
stood beside him, then he drew up his bow and hit him a violent blow with
it, saying, "Do you hurt him while | follow his religion, and say what he
says? Strike me back if you can!" Some of Band Makhzim got up to help
‘Abdi Jalil, but the latter said, "Let Abi “Imarah alone for, by Allah, 1 injured
his nephew deeply.” Hamzah's Islam was complete, and he followed the
Prophet's (pbuh) teachings. When he embraced Islam, the Quraysh
recognized that the Prophet (pbuh) had become stronger, and that Hamzah
‘would protect him, and so they gave up some of their harassment against
him.

The Words of “Utbah ibn Rabi‘ ah
about the Prophet (pbuh)

“Utbuli iba Rabi'ab, who was a master, said one day while he was siting
‘among the Quraysh assembly and the Prophet (pbuh) was sitting in the
mosque alone, "Why should I not go to Muhammad and make some
proposals to him which if he approves some, we will give him whatever he
wants, and he will leave us in peace?" That was after Hamzah had embraced.
Islam and after the number of the Prophet's (pbuh) followers had increased.
‘They accepted. “Utbah sat by the Prophet (pbuh) and said, "O my nephew,
‘you are one of us as you know, of the noblest of the clan and hold a worthy

dividing their unity thereby and ridiculing their way of life, and declared
that their ancestors were disbelievers, $0 listen to me and 1 will make some

Prophet (pbuh) said, “Say (them), O Abul-Walid, 1 am listening." He went on,
“TF iv is money that you Want, we will gather for you of our properties so that

of a man until he can be cured of it.” The Prophet listened patiently, and
then said, "Have you finished, O Abul-Watid?” He replied in the affirmative,
so the Prophet (pbuh) said, "Now listen to me.” He said, "OK." The Prophet
(pbuh) said, (reciting from the Qur'an), In the Name of Allah, the Most
Beneficent, the Most Merciful,

And the Prophet (pbuh) continued to recite it (i.e. Sarat Fussilar) to him.
‘When “Litbah heard this, he listened carefully, putting his hands behind his
‘back and leaning on them as he listened. Then the Prophet (pbuh) ended at a
verse of prostration in the Sirah” and prostrated himself, and said, "You
have heard what vou have heard, O Abul-Waltd, and it is up to you." When
“Utbah went back to his companions they observed that the expression on

Negotiations between the Prophet (pbuh)
and the Chiefs of the Quraysh

Islam kept on spreading in Makkah among men and women of the tribes
of the Quraysh, although they continued to imprison and seduce as many of
the Muslims as they could. The leading men of every clan of the Quraysh ~
Utbah ibn Rabi'ah, Shayban his brother, and Abd Sufyin ibn Harb, and
An-Nadr — ibnul-Harith, Abul-Bakhtari_ ibn Hishim, = Al-Aswad

and Munabbah, the two sons of Hajjaj, and Umayyah ibn Khalaf - all
gathered together after sunset outside the Ka°bah. They decided to send for
Muhammad to negotiate with him so that they would not be held to blame
oon his account in the future.

When they sent for him, the Prophet (pbub) came quickly thinking that
what he had said earlier to them had made an effect. He was keen for their
welfare. and their corrupt way of life upset him. When he sat down with
them, they made it clear to him that they had called him to talk together,
“For by Allah none of the Arabs had ever insulted his people as you have
and they restated the accusations which have been mentioned before.

"Well. Muhammad,” they said, "if you do not accept any of our offers,
you know that no people have shortage of land and water, and live a tougher
life than we do, so ask your Lord, Who has sent you, to move for us these
mountains which enclose us, and to flatten out our country for us, and to

‘They said that if he would not do that for them, let him do something for
himself. “Ask your Lord to send an ange! with you to confirm what you say

of gold and silver to fulfill your wants, because you go to the markets as we
do and earn your livelihood as we do, so that we may know your merit and

“Twill nox do that,” said the Messenger of Allah, “Lam not the one to ask

‘They said, “Then cause the heaven to fall upon us in pieces, as you have
asserted that your Lord ean do so.” The Prophet (pbuh) said, "This is up to At-
lah; if He wants to do it with you, He will do it.” They said, "O Muhammad, did
your Lord not know that we would sit with you, and ask you the
questions, so that He might come to you aind teach you how 10 argue wit

have made all excuses to you O Muhammad. By Allah, we would not leave

Some of them said, "We worship the angels as they are the daughters of
Allah.” Others said, "We will not believe in you until you bring Allah and
the angels before (us) face to face.”

ibn Abi Umayyah ibnul-Mughirah™, the son of his paternal aunt, went with

the Prophet (pbuh) went to his family, sad and depressed, since his hope that
they would have accepted his teachings was in vain, and because they had.

An Act of Aba Jahl

When the Prophet (pbuh) had gone, Abd Jahl spoke, making the usual
charges against him, and saying. “I swear by Allah that I will wait for him
tomorrow with a stone which I ean hardly carry. When he prostrates himself
in prayer I will erack his head with it, Betray me or defend me, let Bani

morning, Abd Jahl took a stone and sat in waiting for the Messenger of
Allah (pbuh), who while in Makkah used to face Syria in prayer. When he
come to offer prayer, he used to stand between the Yemeni corner and the
black stone, putting the Kabah between himself and Syria, The Prophet
(pbuh) rose to offer prayer while the Quraysh sat in their assembly, waiting
for what Aba Jahl was going to do, When the Prophet (pbuh) prostrated
himself, AbG Jah! carried the stone and approached him, until be got close
to hitn and then he turned back, pale with terror, and his hand had shriveled
upon the stone. so he threw it from his hand. When the Quraysh asked him
what had happened, he replied, "When I got close to him a camel stallion
got in between us. By Allah, | have never seen anything like the head, neck,
shoulders, and teeth of that stallion, and he looked as if he would eat me.”

The Story of An-Nadr ibnul-Harith

When Abi Jah! told them what had happened, An-Nadr ibnul-Hirith got
up and said, "O Quraysh, you are in a situation which you cannot deal with.
Muhamniad was a young man, most liked among you, most truthful in
speech, and most trustworthy, until, when he grew up, and brought you his
message, you said he was a sorcerer, but by Allah he is not, for we know the
sorcerers and their spitting and their knots, then you said, a diviner, but by
Allah he is not, for we have seen the behavior of such people and we have
heard their rhymes. And you said that he is a poet, but by Allah he is not a
poet, for we have heard all kinds of poetry, You also said he is possessed or
insane, but hy Allah he is not, for we have seen the possessed by jinn, and
hhe shows no signs of their gasping. whispering, or hallucinations. ©
Quraysh, look to your affairs, for by Allah, it is a serious matter that has
befallen you." An-Nad ibnul-Harith was then one of the devils of Quraysh,
and he used to harm the Prophet (pbuh) and show him animosity. He had
been to Al-Hirah and learnt there the stories of the kings of Persia, and the
tales of Rustam and Isfandiyar. When the Prophet (pbuh) held « meeting in
which he mentioned Allah, and cautioned his people of what had happened
to bygone nations as a result of Allah's wrath, An-Nadr sat down when he
departed, saying, "I can tell 4 better story than his, Come to me.” Then the
began to tell them about the kings of Persia, Rustam and Isfandiydr, and he

would then say, “In what way is Muhammad a better story-teller than am’?
Ibn “Abbas said that eight verses were sent down concerning him: Allah's
the Almighty saying,

When Our Verses (of the Quran) are recited to him, he says, ‘Tales of
the men of old!” >

(AL-Qalam: 15)
and all such tales mentioned concerning him in the Qur'an.

The Polytheists' Animosity
towards the Oppressed Muslims

‘The Quraysh displayed their animosity to all those who followed the
Prophet (pbuh); every clan attacked their Muslims, imprisoning and
torturing them by hunger and thirst, and exposing them to the burning heat
‘of Makkah, so as to draw them away ftom their religion. Some surrendered
under pressure of persecution, and others endured, being protected by Allah.

Bilal, who was later freed by AbO Bakr, at that time belonged to one of
Bandi Jumah. and he was bom as a slave among them, He was a faithful
Muslim and pure of heart. His father's name was Rabéh and his mother was.

‘open valley at the hottest time of day and put a great rock on his chest; then
he would say to him, “By Allah, you will remain like this until you die or
deny Muhammad and worship ALLAt snd Al-Uzzi." Bilal used to say,
enduring this hardship, "One, One!”

Waragah ibn Naufal passed by him while he was being tortured and
saying. ‘One, One!’ and he said. ‘One. one by Allah, O Bildl!”. Then he went
to Umayyah and those of Band Jumaft who were had thus maltreated him,
and said, "I swear by Allah that if you kill him in this way 1 will take his

were torturing him. He said to Umayyah, "Have you no fear of Alah of how

‘was carried out, and Aba Bakr took him and emancipated him

Bilal was the seventh slave to be freed by Abd) Bakr before he emigrated
to Madinah. The other six Muslim slaves were: “Amir ibn Fubayrah, Umm
~Ubays and Zinnirah, who lost her sight when he emancipated her and the
Quraysh said, "ALL&t and Al°Uzed have taken away her sight” but she
said, "By the House of Allah, you lie. Al-Lat and Al-Uzza neither harm nor
profit,” so Allah gave her sight back.

He also freed An-Nahdiyyah and her daughter who were mistreated by
their mistress, a woman of Bund ” Abdud-Dar. He passed by them when she
hhad sent them with some flour of hers, and she was saying, "By Allah, I will
never releuse you." Aba Bakr, said, "Withdraw your oath.” She said,
"Withdraw it? You spoiled them, so you emancipate them.” They agreed
upon the price. and he said, "I take them and they are free, Give her flour
back to her.” They said, "Ought we not to finish the grinding and then take
iv hack to her?” He said, "It is up to you."

He passed by a she-slave of Ban Mu'ammal, who was Mustim, “Umar

him, "My son, 1 see that you are freeing weak slaves. If you want to
manumit, do it with powerful men who could defend you and protect you?”
He said. "Lam doing this for Allah's sake.”

Bani Makhziim used to take “Ammar ibn Yasir out along with his father
‘and mother, who had all embraced Islam, in the heat of day and make them
lie on the burning sand of Makkah, The Prophet (pbuh) passed them by and
said, “Re patient, O family of Yasir! Your meeting-place will be in Paradise.”

The First Migration to Abyssinia

‘When the Prophet (pbuh) saw that he could not protect his Companions
from exposure to persecution and that he was spared of it because of his
rank with Allah and his uncle AbO Talib, he said to them, "You may go 1
Abyssinia, for the king there is fair and will ot cause injustice to anyone and itis
4 friendly country, (s0 vou may stay there) untit Allah will relieve you from your af-
Alction.” Thereupon his Companions went to Abyssinia, being afraid of
seduction and fleeing to Allah with their religion. This was the first
migration in Islam,

‘The first Muslims to go were: “Uthman ibn ‘Affin with his wife
Ruguyyah, the daughter of the Prophet (pbuh); AbO Hudhayfaf ibn “Utbah
with his wife Sahlah, the daughter of Subiayl, Az-Zubayr ibnul? Awwam:
Musab ibn “Umuyr; “Abdur-Rabmin ibn “Awf; Abd Salamah ibn
“Abdel-Asad with his wife Umm Salamah, the daughter of Abd Umayyah;
~Uthman ibn Maz’dn; “Amir ibn Rabiah with his wife Layla, the daughter
of Aba Hathmah; Aba Sabrah ibn Abi Ruhm: and Suhayl ibn Bayda’.
Afterwards, Jafar ibn Abi Talib went, and Muslims followed one after the
‘other until they assembled in Abyssinia. Some took their families and others
went alone, Eighty-three migrants wis the total number who went to
Abyssinia, apart from little children whom they took or who were bom to
them there,

The Quraysh Send their Delegates
to Abyssinia to Extradite the Migrants

When the Quraysh saw that the Prophet's (pbuh) Companions had found
a Secure haven in Abyssinia. they dispatched two staunch men (0 the Negus:
to demand their extradition. so that they could seduce them from their
religion and take them out of their peaceful dwelling. They sent “Amr
ibnul-’ Ag and “Abdullah ibn Abi Rabj ah, before they had embraced Islam.
‘They took with them valuable presents to the king and his patricians, and
they could wit some of the courtiers over to their side.

Umm Salamah, the daughter of AbG Umayyah reported, "When we
reached Abyssinia the Negus gave usa kind refuge. We safely practiced our
religion, and we worshipped Allah, without harm or insult. When the
Quraysh knew, they decided to send two staunch tien (0 the Negus and to
give him selective and luxurious presents from Makkah. Leatherwork was
especially attractive there. so they collected many skins so that they were
able 10 give to all his patricians. They semt “Abdullah and “Amr
commanding them to give each patrician his gift before speaking to the
‘Negus about the migrants, Then they would give their presents to the Negus
and ask him to make the migrants return before he spoke to them. Thus,
they said to each of the patricians, ‘Some foolish persons from our people
have taken asylum in the king's country. They have abandoned the religion
of their people and have not accepted yours, but have brought in an
innovated religion which neither we nor you know anything about, Our
nobles have sent us to the King to help us to have them back, so when we
talk 10 him about them, suggest to him to give them up 10 us without
speaking to them, for their own people have the sharpest insight and know
best about their faults’ The patricians agreed to do so.

They delivered the presents to the Negus and when he had accepted
them, they said to him the same words which they had already said to the
ppatricians about the Muslims, Nothing was more undesirable to “Abdullith
‘and “Amv than that the Negus should hear what the Muslims would say. The
patricians said that the men had spoken the truth, and their own people were
the best to know the truth of the migrants, They advised him to return them

<br><br><br>

to their own people. The Negus became angry and suid, ‘No, By Allah I will
‘not relinquish them. No people who have sought my asylum, dwelled in my
country, and selected me rather than others, shall be betrayed, until I call
them and ask them about what these two men claim. If they are as they say,
{ will send them back to their own people; but if what they say is wrong, I
will defend them and they will receive suitable hospitality while under my
‘guardianship.’

‘Then he summoned the Prophet's Companions, and when his messenger
came they gathered, saying one to another, ‘What will you tell the man when
you meet him? They said, ‘We shall say what we know and what our
Prophet (pbuh) ordered us. Let it be as it goes.’ When they went to the king
they found that he had called his bishops with their sacred books all
displayed around him. He asked them what their religion was for which they
‘had abandoried their people, without embracing in his religion or any other.
Ja‘far ibn Abi Talib stood up and said,

‘O king! We were plunged in the depths of ignorance, and we were
idolaters. We used to eat corpses, to commit abominations, to severe blood
ties, 1o neglect our duties of hospitality and neighborliness, and to use only
the Iw of the strong. That was our life until Allah raised among us a man,
whose lineage, truthfulness, honesty, and purity we knew. He called us to
the Oneness of Allah, and taught us not to associate anything with Him. He
forbade us the worship of idols. and enjoined us to speak the truth, to be
faithful to our trusts, to be merciful and to regard the rights of the neighbors
as well as kith and kin, and to refrain from crimes and bloodshed. He
prohibited us from committing abominations, speaking lies, devouring the
property of orphans, and vilifying chaste women, He commanded us to offer
Prayers. to render alms, and to observe fasts. We have believed in him, have
accepted his teachings, and have followed him, We have allowed what He
has allowed. and have prohibited what he has prohibited. For this reason,
our people attacked us, und persecuted us in order to force us to abandon the
worship of Allah and return to the worship of idols and to regard as lawful
the evil deeds we once committed. When they had tortured and encircled
our lives, until finding no safely among them, we have come to your
country, and hope you will protect us from oppression while we are with
you, O kmg.’

‘The Negus avked if they had with them anything of Allah's revelation,
When Jafar said that he had, the Negus asked him to recite it to him, so he
recited the opening verses of Siirar Maryam. Thereupon, by Allah, the
‘Negus, along with the bishops, wept to the extent that the king's tears wet
his beard and those of the bishops wet their scrolls. Here, the Negus

‘When the two had gone, “Ame said, ‘Tomorrow I will tell him something

said, ‘Do not do it, for they are still our kindred though they oppose us.” He
said, "By Allah, T will tell him that they claim that Jesus, the son of Maryam,

the son of Maryam, and that he should summon them to ask ubout it. He did

gathered together asking one another what they should say about “isd when
they were to be asked, They decided that they would say what Allah had
said and what the Prophet (pbuh) had brought. So when they went into the
king and the question was raised to them, Jafar answered, "We say about
him that which our Prophet (pbuh) has brought, saying, he is the servant of
Allah, His Prophet, His Spirit, and His Word. which He breathed into,
Maryam the Virgin.” The Negus took a stick from the ground and said, “By
Allah, Jesus, the son of Maryam, does not exceed what you have said by the
length of this stick.” His bishops round him got angry when he said this, and
said, Even though they gnaw, by Allah! Go, for you are safe in my country.
Whoever insults you will be punished. Whoever insults you will be
punished. Not even for a mountain of gold will I allow that any man of you
should be hurt’. He tetumed the presents to them and so they left his
Presence, downcast, taking away their rejected presents, while we lived
unmolested in the best security.

While we were living thus, a revolt arose to overthrow him, and I never
knew grief as we did at that, fearing that the rebellion would remove the
Negus, and that a new ruler would come who did not know our case like the

The Boycott

A series of events baffled the Quraysh: the peaceful settlement of the
Prophet's (pbuh) Companions in Abyssinia under the protection of the
Negus, the conversion of “Umar and Hamzah to Islam, and the spreading of
Sam among the tribes. They held a meeting and decided to write a

the boycott were: not to marry their Women nor give their women to them to

When the Quraysh did that, the two clans of Band Hashim and Band

nephew, Abd Lahab “Abdul-Uz26 split from Bandi Hiishim to support the
Quraysh. He used to say, "Muhammad is promising things whieh T cannot

hands after that?" Then he blew in his hands and said, "May you be cut. I
‘can see nothing in you of the things which Muhammad says.” So Allah sent

to be revealed on the wickedness of the Quraysh and those hostile to him;

paying their price. When Khabbab asked for his due payment, he said, "O
Khabbab, is it not that Muhammad, your friend, whose religion you follow,
alleges that in Paradise there will be all which are desired by people of gold,
silver, clothes, and servants?” "Certainly," answered Khabbab. “Then give
ime a respite to the Day of Resurrection until | go there (Paradise) and pay
your debt there, for by Allah, you and your friend will never be more
referable in the sight of Allah than me nor will you have greater share in
this than me,” said Al Ag. Then Allah sent down concerning him,

{Have you seen him who dishelieved in Our Ayét (this Qur'an and Mu-
anmad) and (yet) says: I shall certainty be given wealth and children
Jif Uwill be alive (again)}.” Has he known the unseen or has he taken a
covenant from the Most Beneficent (Allah)? Nay! We shall record what
Jie says, and We shall increase his torment (in the Hell); and We shall
inherit from him (at his death} all that he talks of (ie. wealth and chit-
dren which We have bestowed upon hint in this warld), and he shat
‘come to Us alone.

(Maryam: 77-80)

‘Abu Jahl met the Prophet (pbuh), and said to him, "By Allah, O

Muhammad, either you cease to insult our gods or we will insult yours.” So
Allah tevealed concerning that,

é An insult not those whom they (dishelievers) worship besides Allah,
lest they insult Allah wrongfully without knowledge.

(AL-An*am: 108)

I was told that the Prophet (pbuh) abstained from insulting their gods,
and began to invite them to believe in Allah.

An-Nadr ibnul-Harith ibn “Algamah ibn Kaladah ibn “Abd Manaf ibn
“Abdud-Dar ibn Qusayy, whenever the Prophet (pbuh) sat in a gathering
calling people 10 Allah, reading from the Quran, and forewarning them of
what happened to bygone nations, followed him after he had left and
narrated stories about Rustam Ash-Shid, Isfandiyar, and the kings of Persia,
then he would say, "By Allah, Mahammad cannot tell a better story than
mine and his words are just tales of the ancients. which he has written down
as [ have.” So Allah revealed the following concerning him,

—@o—


<br><br><br>

And they sav: Tates of the ancients, which he has writen down, and
they are dictated t0 him morning and afternoon.’ Say: ht (this Qur'an)
‘has been sent down by Him (Allah) (the Real Lord of the heavens and
earth) Who knows the secret of the heavens and the earth, Truly, He is
Ofi-Forgiving, Most Merciful’
(Al-Burgan: 5-6)
and,
£ When Our Verses (of the Qur'an) are recited 10 him. he says: ‘Tales of
the men of old!” »
(Al-Qalam: 15)
and,
Woe to every sinful lar, who hears the Verses of Allah (being) recited
10 him. yet persists with pride as if he heard them nor. So announce to
him a painful torment!
(Al-Jathiyah: 7-8)
Al-Akhnas iba Shurayg ibn Wahb Ath-Thagaft was one of the notables
Who had influence on his people. He was against the Prophet (pbuh) and
used to harass him by words, so Allah sent down about him,
And obey not everyone who swears much, and is considered worthless,
a slanderer, going about with calumnies, hinderer of the good, trans-
sressor, sinful, cruel, afer all that hase-born (of illegitimate birth). >
{Al-Qaam: 10-13)

Al Walid ibnul-Mughirah said, “Is it revealed to Muhammad and Tam
ignored, though 1 am the chief and master of the Quraysh, and Ab0 Mas‘Gd
Amr ibn Umayr ath-Thagafi, the master of Thaqif, is also ignored, though
we are the masters of the two towns” Then Allah sent down concerning
him,

¢And they say: ‘Why is not this Qur'an sent down to some great man of
the nwo towns (Makkah and Tai)” Is it they who would portion out the
Mercy of your Lard? lt is We Who portion out between them their live-
lihood in this world, and We raised some of them above others in ranks,

“\ighah ibn Abi Ma’il once sat with the Prophet (pbuh) and listened to
his preaching of Islam, When his close friend Ubayy ibn Khalaf heard of
that, he said to him, "I have heard that you have sat with Muhammad and
listened to him? 1 swear Iwill never see or talk to you again - and he swore
a great oath - if you do it again, or if you do not go and spit in his face."
“Ugbah, the enemy of Allsh and may Allah curse him, did this. So Allah
revealed about both of them,

4And (remember) the Day when the Zalim (wrong-doer, oppressor, pol-
ytheist, etc.) will bite at his hands, he will say: "Oh! Would shat had
taken a path with the Messenger (Muhammad)! Al! Woe to me! Would
that 1 had never taken so-and-so as a friend! He indeed led me astray
{from the Reminder (this Qur'an) after it had came to me, And Shaytin
(Satan) is ever a deserter to man in the hour of need. >
(AL-Furqin: 27-29)
Ubayy went to the Prophet (pbuh) with a decomposed bone, ground to
pieces, and said, "O Muhammad, do you allege that Allah can cevive this
after they are rotten?” Then he crumbled it in his hand and blew the powder
towards the Prophet's (pbuh) face. The Prophet (pbuh) answered, "Yes, 1 say
‘that, Allah will resurrect itand you, after you have become lke this, then Allah will
‘make you enter Hell.” So Allah revealed concerning him,

And he pus forth for Us a parable, and forgets his own creation. He
says: ‘Who will give life to these bones when they have rotted away and
huave become dust?’ Say (O Muhammad), ‘He will give life to them Who
‘created them for the first time! And He is the All-Knower of every crea-
tion! He, Who produces for you fire out of the green tree, when behold!
You kindle therewith.’

(Yasin; 78-80)

‘You uuu we will associate wgether on the issue, ID that which you Worship

(Ab Kifirdin: 1-6)

After Allah had mentioned the tree of Az-Zaggiim to frighten the
polytheists Abit Jahl ibn Hishim said, "O Quraysh, do you know what the
tree of Az-Zaggiim is with which Muhammad frightens you?” When they
said “No”, he said, "It is Yathrib butiered dates. By Allah, if we get hold of
them we will take them in one draught!” So Allah sent down conceming

Verily, the tee of Zaggiim will be the food of the sinners, like boiling
oil, {twill boil in the bellies, like the boiling of scalding water.»
(Ad-Dukhan: 43-46)
i.e. not like Abd Jahi's allegation,

Al-Walid ibnul-Mughirah was talking to the Prophet (pbuh) who was
eager to revert him to Islam when fbn Umm Maktum, a blind man, came
and ask the Prophet (pbuh) to recite the Qur'an to him. He persisted on his
request to the extent that the Prophet (pbuh) became annoyed, because he
diverted him from Al-Walid and spoiled the opportunity of his talk; and
‘when the man felt that he was importunate he turned away frowning and left
him. So Allah sent down on the Prophet (pbuh),

‘The people who used to harm the Prophet (pbuh) in his house were: AbO
Lahab, Al-Hakam ibn Abel As, “Uqbah ibn Abi Ma‘, “Adiyy ibn Hamrat
ath-Thagafi, and Ibnul-Asda’ al-Hadhlf, They were his neighbors and from
among them all only Al-Hakam ibn Abel-As embraced {slam later. One of
them threw the entrails of a goat on his back while he was performing his
prayers. Another used to throw it in his stony vessel. As a result the Prophet
(pbuh) resorted to a wall 1o be concealed during prayer. Whenever they did
that to him he used to take such filthy things and stand at the thrower's door.

the (pbuh) would cast it away.

The Return of the Migrants to Abyssinia

False news reached the Prophet's (pbuh) Companions who had migrated
to Abyssinia that the people of Makkah had embraced Islam, so they
decided to return home. When they approached Makkah they knew that the
report was untrue, Likewise, they entered the town cither under the
protection of a local notable or by stealth. Thiny-three men was the total
number of the Companions who came back to Makkih from Abyssinia.
Among them were: “Uthmian ibn Maz‘dn protected by Al-Walid
ibnul-Mughirah; Aba Salamah under the protection of Abd Talib who was
his uncle, Aba Salamah's mother being Burrah, the daughter of

The Annulment of the Boycott

According to the document written by the Quraysh the two clans of
Band Hashim and Band Al-Mugalib were still residing in the mountain

passes of Makkah, when a number of the Qurayshis moved to repeal the
boycott against them. Hishdm ibn “Amr endured the most hardship in this
task, since he was the son of a brother to Nadlah ibn Hashim. ibn “Abd
‘Manaf by bis mother and was closely attached to Band Hashim, He was
highly respected by his people. He used to take a camel laden with food by
night to these two clans in their residence, When he had taken it to the
beginning of the alley, he took off its halter, gave it a thump on the side, 10
Jet it walk into the alley to them. He also used to send clothes to them in the
‘same way.

Hishm went to Zuhayr ibn Abi Umayyah ibnul-Mughirab, the son of
~Atikuh. the daughter of “Abdul-Mutialib and said, "Are you pleased to eat
food, put on clothes, and marry women while you know of the distress of
your matemal uncles? They can neither buy nor sell, nor marry, nor give in
marriage. I swear by Allah that if they were the (matemal) uncles of
Abul-Hakam ibn Hishm and you asked him to do to them what he had
asked you to do, he would never do it.” He said, “Confound you, Hishim,
what can | do? 1 am only one person, By Allah, if 1 had another man to.
support me I would soon repeal it.” He said, "I have found a man, Myself.”
“We need @ third one." said he. So Hishim spoke to Al-Mut'im ibn “Adiyy
and said, "Are you pleased that two clans of Band “Abd Mundf should die
while you are a witness and approve to follow the Quraysh? By Allah, by
encouraging them to do so, they will soon do the same to you.” He agreed to
help them but, like Zuhayr, he demanded for a fourth person. He went to
Abul-Bakhtari ibn Hishim who asked for a fifth man and then to Zama°ab
ibnul-Aswad ibnul-Muyalib ibn Asad reminding him about their kinship
aand their rights.

‘They met at night at the nearest point of Al-Hajin above Makkah, They
discussed the question of the document to secure its annulment, Zubiayr
demanded to be the first to speak and act. In the morning, when the people
met together Zuhayr, after circumambuluting the Ka’bah seven times,
approached the hosts of people there and said, "O people of Makkah, are we
to eat and dress while Band Hashim die, and cannot buy or sell? By Allah I
‘will not sit down until this unjust boycotting document is pulled out!" Abt
Jahl, who was at the side of the mosque, cried out, "You lie by Allah. It

shall not be torn up.” Zama°ah said, “You are a greater liar, we were not
pleased with the document since it has been written." Abul-Bakhtari said,
"Zamatah is right. We are not satisfied with what is written and we do not
admit it." AlMuim said, “You are both right and anyone who says
‘otherwise is a liar. We call Allah to witness that we free ourselves from all
that is written in the document. Hishiim spoke in the same sense. Abdi Jah
said, "This is a decision taken overnight. which you have been discussing
elsewhere.” Abi Talib was sitting at the comer of the mosque. When
Al-Mut im went up to the document to (ear it to pieces he found that worms
hhad already caten it save the part that contained, "In the name of You, O
Allah". The writer of the document was MansOr ibn “Ikrimah, and his hand,
as it was said, had been paralyzed.

The Story of the Irashi Man
Who Sold his Camels to Aba Jahl

Ibn Ishaq said that “Abdul-Malik ibn “Abdullah iba Abd Sufyan
ath-Thagafi who had a good memory, told him that a man from Irdish sold
some of his camels to AbQ Jahl in Makkah. Nevertheless, he withheld the
money, so the man went to the assembly of the Quraysh when the Prophet
(pbuh) was sitting at the corner of the Mosque and said, "Who among you
‘can help me get my due payment from Abul-Hakam ibn Hisham? I am a
stranger and a wayfarer, and be has taken my right.” They said, "Do you see
that man sitting over there?” and they pointed to the Prophet (pbuh), aiming
to make a joke of him for they knew quite well of the hostility between him
and Abd Jahl, They added, "Go to him, and he will help you to get your
right.”

The Lrstii man went to the Prophet (pbuh) and said, "O servant of Allah,
Abul-Hakam ibn Hisham has withheld the money he owes me, T ain a
stranger and Wayfarer. When I asked these men to tell me of someone who
would help me to get my right they advised me to come to you, so go and
bring me my money from him, may Allah bless you.” The Prophet (pbuh)
said, "Go to him” and they went to him together. When the men saw this,
they sent a man to follow them. The Prophet (pbub) went and knocked at

<br><br><br>

Abii Jahi's door, and when he asked who was there he said, “Muhammad!
Come out to me.” He came out to him pale with terror, and the Prophet
(pbuh) said, "Give this man his due." "Do not leave until I get him his
money,” he said, and went inside and came out with the due payment and
gave it to the man. The Prophet (pbuh) went away saying, "Go to your busi-
ness." The Irishi man returned to the assembly and said, "May Allah reward
him, for he has got me my right."

‘The man, who went after them reported, "It was something unusual," he
said, “Hardly had he knocked at his door when he came out bloodless with
fear." Just after relating what had happened. Abd Fahl himself appeared and
they said, "What lias happened to you? We have never seen you doing like
‘what you have done.” "“Confound you,” he said, "By Allah, as soon as he
Knocked on my door and I heard his voice I was terrified. Then I went out to
him. A camel stallion was high above his head. I have never seen such a
stallion before with such a head, shoulders and canines. By Allah, if 1 had
‘nol paid hitn, the stallion would have devoured me.”

The Night Journey

Islam prevailed in Makkah among the Quraysh and all the tribes, when
the Messenger of Allah (pbuh) was made to set forth by night from the
Inviolable Mosque at Makkah to Al-Agsa Mosque”. As I was told,
“Abdullah ibn Mas‘Od said, The Burdg, the animal whose every stride went
as far as its eye could reach, and which was ridden by the previous prophets,
was brought to the Prophet (pbuh). He (pbuh) was made to mount on it and
hhe went out with his companion (Jibril) (0 see the marvels between the
heavens and the earth, until he reached Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem.
There he found (Prophet) Ibrahim, the intimate friend of Allah. He also
found Masa and “Isa gathered in a company of some Prophets. He led them
in prayer, then he was brought three vessels, containing milk, khamr, and
water respectively. The Messenger of Allah (pbuh) said,

“Theard.a voice saying when these were offered to me, If he chooses the
water he will be drowned as well as his nation; if chooses the khamr he

<br><br><br>

will be misguided as well as his nation; and if he chases the milk he
will be rightly guided as well as his nation.” So I took the vessel of mitk
and drank from it. So Jibrl, peace be upon him, said to me, "You have
‘seem righly guided and so will your nation be, Q Muhammad.’

Ibn Ishq said he was told on the authority of Al-Hasan that the Prophet
(pbuh) suid,

"While P was sleeping in the Hijr, Jibril came and spurred me with his
foot. I sat up and saw nothing so 1 slept again. He came a second time
‘and spurred me with his foot. Isat up and saw nothing so 1 slept again.
He came 10 me the third time and spurred me with his foot. sat up. he
ook hold of my arm andl 1 stood beside him. Then he took me out to the
door of the Mosque. There stood a white beast, half mule, half donkey,
with 1wo wings at its thighs 10 propel its feet with them, puting down
‘each forefoot at the limit of its sight. He bore me onto it then he went aut
with me keeping close to me.’ ”

Al-Hasan continued, “The Prophet (pbuh) and Jibril went their way until
they arrived at Al-Agsa Mosque: There he found Tbrihim, MGsa, and “Is
among a company of the Prophets. The Prophet (pbuh) was their Imam in
prayers. Then he was brought two vessels, one of Khiamr and the other of
milk, The Prophet (pbuh) selected the milk and drank from it, leaving the
khamt. Jibril said, "You have been rightly guided to (innate) nature and so
will your nation be © Muhammad, and Khamr is prohibited to you. The
Prophet (pbuh) returned to Makkah. In the morning, he told the Quraysh
about what had happened. Most of them said, ‘By Allah, this is clear
nonsense! A caravan takes a month to go to Syria and another to return, did
‘Muhanimad go and return in one night? Many apostatized after they had
embraced [stam: some people asked Ab Bakr, What do you think of your
friend, AbQ Bakr? He alleges that he went to Al-Aqsa Mosque last night,
offered prayer in it, and returned to Makkah.’ He answered that they were
lying about the Prophet (pbuh), but they asserted it and said that he was then
in the Mosque telling the people about it. Abd Bakr said, "By Allah, if he
says so then it is true. And what is amazing in that? By Allah, he tells me
that a revelation from Allah comes down to him from the heavens to the
earth in an hour of a day or night and 1 do believe him, and that is more
uncommon than that at which you wonder!’ He then went to the Prophet
(pbuh) and knew that these reports were true. Aba Bake said. 'O Prophet of

<br><br><br>

Allah, have you told the people that you went to Al-Aqsa Mosque last
night? The Prophet (pbuh) answered in the affirmative, so Abd Bakr said,
‘O Prophet of Allah, describe it to me, for I have been there.’ (Al-Hasan said
that) The Prophet (pbuh) said, "1 has been elevated t0 me so as to be uble to see
i’ He (pbuh) kept on describing it, while Abd Bake said, “That is true. 1
verify that you are the Messenger of Allah’ until he had finished the
description. Then the Prophet (pbuh) said, ‘And you, Ahi Bakr, are As-Siddig
(the verifier of ruth). Since then he was entitled As-Siddig.

It is narrated on the authority of Sa’fd ibnul-Musayyab that the Prophet
(pbuh) described to his Companions Ibrahim, Misa, and “isd, as he saw
them that night, saying,

“have never seen a man most resembling me as lbréhim nor a man whom L
‘most resemble like him, Masé was a brown man, tall, with light flesh,
‘curly hair, and hooked nose, as if he were a man of the Shanitah. ‘Isa.
the son of Maryam, was a reddish man of medium height, ank hair, with
‘many black moles om his face, as if he had just come from a bath. One
would think that his head was dripping with water. The one among you
who looks lke him most is “Urwah ibn Mas*aid ath-Thagafi.”

The Story of the Ascent

Tn Ishaq said it was narrated that AbG Sa’id al-Kudri reported, “I heard
the Prophet (pbuh) saying,

‘Mter the events in Al-Aqsa Mosque, a mi'réj (stairway) was brought to
‘me. which I have never seen as fine as such before. It is that at which the
dying person among you stares when death approaches. My companion
(ibril) helped me mount it (and ascended with me) until we reached one
of the gates of heaven called the Gate of the Preservers, An angel called
Ismav tl was in charge of it. and under his control were nwelve thousand
angels, under each of them another twelve thousand angels."

Here the Prophet (pbuh) recited,
‘4 And none can know the hosts of your Lord but He.
(Al-Muddaththir: 31)

(The Prophet continued,

When Jibril brought me in, Ismail asked, Who is he, O Jibril?” He said,
‘He is Muhammad.’ He asked if I had been given a mission, and on hear-
ing es" he prayed for me.

When 1 entered the first heaven (the words are fram the Prophet (pbuh)
1 saw a man sitting and before him the souls of the sons af Adam were
presented. To some he would see good and would be pleased with, say
ing, ‘A good soul from a good body’ and of others he would say to it a
wand of disrespect and frown, and say, ‘An evil soul from an evil body’
When f asked Jibril who this man was, he told me that he was our father
‘Adam before whom the souls of his progeny are presented; the believer's
soul rejoices him, and he would say. ‘A good soul from a good body’
while the dsbeliever's soul makes him disgusted and he dislikes itso that
hhe would say, ‘An evil soul from an evil body’

Then I saw men with lips like those of camels: in their hands were pieces
of fire similar to stones that they would cast into their mouths and they
would come out of their rears. asked Jibril who those men were and he
told that they were those who unwith justice devoured the wealth of the
‘onpheans

Then I saw men in the path of the people of Pharaoh with such bellies
like which I have never seen hefore. They (the people of Pharaoh} were
passing over them like thirsty camels while they were being exposed to
the fire, treading them down and they were not able ta divert away from
their place. | asked Jibril who those men were and he told me that they
were those who devoured riba.

Then I saw men before whom there was good fleshy meat sided hy lean
rotten meat. and they were eating of the lean rotten meat and leaving the
‘good fleshy one. I asked Jibrit who those men were and he told me that
they were those who abandoned the women whont Allah had made law-
{ul for them and pursue those women whom He had prohibited for them.

Then I save women hanging by their breasts. 1 asked Jibril who those
women were and he told me that they were thase women who attributed
to their husbands children who were nor theirs,

Then he ascended with me to the seeonul heaven where were the two ra-
ternal cousins ‘Ist, the son of Maryam, and Yahya, the son of Zakariyya.
Up 10 the third heaven saw a man iho looked like the full moon, 1
asked Jibril who that man was and he told me that he was my brother

‘The narrator said the Prophet (pbuh) recited,

(The Prophet (pbuh) continued.)

‘Then he ascended with me to the fifth heaven where there was an old
‘man sho had a white hair and a long big beard: I had never seen a
more handsome old mar than ke was. | asked Jibril who that man was

found a dark long man with a hooked nose as if he was one of the men of
the Shaniiah, On asking him about that man Jibril told me that he was
‘my brother Masa. the son of “lmrin. Up to the seventh heaven there was
‘an old! man sitting on a chair beside At-Bayt al-Ma’miit: every day

lips. I asked her to whom she belonged, as she pleased me when 1 saw
her; and she tld me that she belonged to Zayd ibn Harithah,’

‘The narrator said that (on his return), the Prophet (pbuh) gave Zayd the
good news about her. (The Prophet (pbuh) continued,)

went away and passed by Masi and he advised the same again. I went

vised the same again. I went back and asked Him (for further reduction)

Aba Talib and Khadijah Die

Khadijah and AbGi Talib passed away in the same year. After Khadijah’s
death troubles followed one after another, for she had been a faithful help
‘and comfort to him in Islam. With the death of Abd Talib he lost a support
and stay in his personal life, and a fortification and protection against the
Quraysh. The death of Abd Talib was about three years before the
Emigration to Madinah. During this period, the Quraysh began to increase
their maltreatment and insult him in a way that they would have never had
the courage to follow when his uncle was alive.

A young fool actually hurled dust on his head. The Prophet (pbuh) went
home with the dust on his head. A daughter of his wept while she was
washing it. "Do not ery, daughter.” he said, "for Allah will protect your father.”
Meanwhile he was saying, "The Quraysh had! never done to me anything dis-
likable to me until Abi Talib died.”

When the Quraysh knew of the severe illness of Abd ‘Dilib, they
reminded each other that Hamzah and “Umar had become Muslims as well

as the fuct that Muhammad's affairs prevailed among all the Qurayshi clans,
They decided to go to Aba Tilit to reach a sort of compromise lest they be
constrained in their authority altogether.

thn “Abbas reported that the nobles of the Quraysh among whom were
“Utbith and Shaybah, the sons of Rabi'ah, Abd Jahl, Umayyah ibn Khalaf,
and Abi Sufyan, went to AbG Talib and said, “You know your position
among us and now in your current condition we are deeply concerned about
you. You know the problems between us and your nephew. Summon him
and let us make a bargain that he witl feave us alone and we will leave him
alone; let him have his religion and we will have outs.” When he (pbuh)
came, Ab@ Talib said, “O nephew, here are notables of your people who
have gathered so as to give and take from you.” "Yes," he answered. “Let you
{all) give me one word by which you ean rule the Arabs and subject the non-Arab
‘o vou." "Yes, by your father, and ten words.” said Abd Jahl. He said, “Say,
‘there és no god bus Allah’ and renounie whatt you worship other than Him.” They
clapped their hands (astoundingly) and said, “Do you want to make all the
gods in one god, © Muhammad? That is an extraordinary matter". Then
they said one to another, “This man will not give you anything that you
want, so go and be with the religion of your forefathers until Allah judges
between you and him.” So they left.

Abii Talib said to the Prophet (pbuh), “By Allah © nephew, I do not
think that you asked them something, nonsense.” On hearing this, the
Prophet (pbuh) wished that he would embrace Islam, and he said at ance, “O
uncle, say it, and | shall ask {my Lord) to make it lawful (for me) because of it to
intercede for you on the Resurrection Day.” Seeing the Prophet's enthusiasm he
answered, “Were it not that 1 am afraid that you and your family would be
disgraced after my death and that the Quraysh would think that I had only
said it in fear of death, I would say it. Lam not saying it but for pleasing you
with it." As his death was approaching, Al-" Abbas found AbG Talib moving
his lips, so he put his ear close to him and said, “O nephew, by Allah, my
brother has spoken the word you ordered him to say.” The Prophet (pbuh)
replied, “! did not heart."

Allah sent down concemning those who met with him and the sayings
and replies they exchanged,

The Prophet (pbuh) Goes
to Thaqif Seeking Support

As a result of the increasing enmity of the Quraysh after his uncle's
death, the Prophet (pbuh) went to ALTAif seeking support from the Thagif
to defend him against his tribe. At the same time he wished that they would
accept the Message which Allah bad sent him with. He went alone.

Arriving ALTE the Prophet (pbuh) headed to certain personalities of
the Thagif who were then their notables and chiefs, namely three brothers:
“Abd Yalil. Mas'Od, and Habib, the sons of "Amr iba “Umayt. One of them
had a Qurayshi wile of Band Jumab. The Prophet (pbuh) sat with them,
called them to Islam and asked their support against his adversaries at home.
“Twill tear the cloths of the Kabah if Allah has sent you as a Messenger?”
said one of them. "Did not Allah find anyone other than you to send?” said
the second. "I swear by Allah that I will never have any contact with you. If
‘you are really the Messenger of Allah. then you are too dangerous 10 reply
to your words; and if you are belying Allah, then I feel itis imperative not
10 speak to you.” said the third.

<br><br><br>

‘So the Prophet (pbuh) got up and said to them, “Seeing that you have acted
‘as you have, keep the matter secret,” for he did not like that his people would
know it, so that they would further hurt him. On the contrary they stirred up
their louts and slaves to scorn him and ridicule him as he was pursued by a
mob. He sought refuge and rested against the shade of a wall of a vineyard
‘of an orchard possessed by “Utbah ibn Rabi-ah and his brother Shaybah who
were in it at that time watching him. The Prophet (pbuh) met the woman
from Band Jumah and said to her, "(Do you see) what ha occurred t0 us from
‘your husband's people?”

1 was told that when the Prophet (pbuh) reached safely he said,

“O Allah! To You I complain of my weakness, of my helplessness, and
iy insignificance before men. O Mast Merciful of the merciful, You are
the Lord of the helpless and You are my Lord! Into whose hands would
You entrust me? Into the hands of a remote person who would scowl at
‘me. or ta an enemy who You have given control over my affairs? If You
‘are not angry with me, Ido wot eare; but Your clemency ts more wide for
ime. 1 seek refuge with the Light of Your Countenance, whereby all dark-
ness és iluninated, and of Which all affairs are ordered in this world as
well as in the Hereafter, from (any possibility) that You should send
down Your anger or that I should incur Your wrath, Itis for me to return
10 You until You are well satisfied! There is no means nor might save
with You!*

Seeing him in this difficult situation, “Utbah and Shaybah, were moved
fon the grounds of kinship and compassion, and sent to him a young
Christian slave called “Addis with a tray of grapes. “Addis didso, and on
ppulting his hand in the platter the Prophet (pbuh) said, "Mr the name of Allah,”
then he started eating. “Addis looked at his face and said, “By Allah, the
peopie in this land do not use these words.” The Prophet (pbuh) then asked.
"Then from which counary do vou come, O “Adidas? And what is your religion?”
He replied that he was a Christian and came from Ninaw'.” “From the own
of the righteous man Yiinus, the son of Mata?” suid the Prophet (pbuh). "How
did you know about YOnus, the son of Matta?” asked “Addis. "He is my
brother; he was a Prophet and so um 1," remarked the Messenger of Allah
(pbuh). “Addis bent over him kissing his head, hands, and feet.

Do not let him seduce you from your religion, as yours is better than his."

The Jinn of Nasibin

On his way back from At-Taif. the Prophet (pbuh) was desperate of to
get anything out of the Thagif, When he reached Nakhiah!"’, he rose to offer
prayer in the middle of the night, and seven Jinns from Nasibin whom Allah
has mentioned (in the Qur'an) passed by. They listened to him. When he
ended his prayer they went to their people to wam them, as they had
believed and responded to what they had heard, Allah the Almighty told the
Prophet (pbuh) about them in the verses:

EAnd (remember) when We sent towards you (Muhammad) Nafran
(three to ten persons) of the jinns. (quietly) listening to the Qur'an.” 10
the words”..ana will save you from a painful torment (ie. Heli-fre).

(Al-Ahgiif 29-31)
Also in this regard Allah the Almighty says,

Say (0 Muhammad): ‘It hax been revealed to me that a group (from
three 10 ten in number) of jinns listened (to this Qur'an).

The Prophet (pbuh) Extends his Preaching
to Other Tribes

Whenever a chance came at the seasons of pilgrimage, the Prophet
(pbuh) contacted the Arab tribes to invite them to believe in Allah and that
he was a Prophet who had been sent by Him. He asked for their protection

<br><br><br>

‘until Allah should make His Message prevail. Rabf'ah ibn “Abad said,
"When I was a young boy with my father in Mina, the Prophet (pbuh) used
{0 stop at the houses of the Arab tribes saying,

‘0 Bani so an so, 1 am Allak’s Messenger to you. He commands you to
worship Him and not 10 associate anything with Him, and to abandon
those (things that you take as) rivals (to Allah and) that you worship ath-
er than Him, and to believe in me, support me. and protect me until Lan
present what Allah has sent me for.”

During this. he was followed by an artful and spruce man with two locks
‘of hair, wearing an Aden cloak. Whenever the Prophet (pbuh) ended his call
he used to say, ‘This man calls to you to desert Al-Lit and Al“Uzza and
‘your associates of the jinn of Band Malik ibn Ugaysh for the misguiding
innovation he has brought, so do not obey or listen to him I asked my
father about this man who followed him to recant what he said, and he
answered that it was the Prophet's uncle *Abdul-"Uzza ibn “Abdul-Muttalib,
ie, Aba Lahab,”

Thn Ishq said, “thn Shihib az-Zubri reported that he went to the
encampments of the Kanadah where was a chief of theirs called Mulayh. He
called them to believe in Allah and introduced himself, but they renounced
him. He also went to Band “Amir ibn Sa°sa'ah and called them to abandon
idolatry and join him. One of them called Baybarah ibn Firis said, “By
Allah, if | could take this man from the Quraysh 1 would eat up the Arabs
with him.’ Then he asked him, “If we give you allegiance and Allah gives
you power over your opponents, ‘shall we have authority after you?’ The
Prophet (pbuh) replied, "The whole affair lies in Allah's Hands and He manages
it.as He wills: The man conimented, 'Do you expect us to incur the wrath and
‘vengeance of the Arabs for you and then if Allah gives you victory someone
else will reap the benefit? We do not need to interfere,’ and they refused to
help him.

Afterwards when Band “Amir returned home, they were accustomed (0
give the news of the fairs to an old man of theirs who lingered behind
because of his old age. They said him, ‘A young man of the Quraysh, of
Bani ~Abdul-Muttalib claims that he is a Prophet. He contacted us and



<br><br><br>

asked us to support, protect, and take him to our land.’ The old man put his
hands upon his head und said, ‘O Band “Amir, could it have been regained!
‘What a loss of opportunity! None of the descendents of Ismail has ever
claimed it (ie. prophethood) falsely. It is the truth. Where was your
‘common sense?"

Abdullih ibn Ka’b reported that the Messenger of Allah (pbuh) went to
the houses of Band Hanifah to call them to Allah and to introduce himself,
but none of the Arabs were as repulsive in their denial as they were, The
Prophet (pbuh) kept on introducing himself to the tribes inviting them to
believe in Allah and Islam, and whenever men came together at the fairs or
he heard of any of the notables coming to Makkah than he went to them
with his message.

Suwayd ibn Sémit of Band “Ame ibn “Awf, went to Makkah for
pilgrimage. When the Prophet (pbuh) heard about him he sought him out, 10
call him to Islam, Suwayd said to the Prophet (pbuh), "Pechaps you have
something like what I have.” “And what is thar?” asked the Prophet (pbuh),
“The scroll of Lugmiin,” (i. the wisdom of Lugmiin), he answered. “Show it
10 me,” said the Prophet (pbuh). and he handed it over. The Prophet (pbuh)
then siid, “These are good words, and whar I have is better than this: a Qur'an
that Allah the Almighty has sent down to me, which is a guidance and a light.
‘Then he (pbuh) recited some verses from the Qur'an, and invited him to
Islam. The man did not refuse it but said, “This is a fine speech.” When he
returned to his people in Madinah, he was soon killed by the Khazraj. Some
of his people said, "We think that he had been a Muslim when he was
killed”; he was killed prior to the battle of Bu’ ath.

The Ansar Embrace Islam

When Allah ordained to give sovereignty to His religion, to strengthen
His Prophet (pbuh), and to fulfil His Promise to him, the Prophet (pbuh) met
a number of Madinah residents (who were later known as the Ansar) at the
season of pilgrimage. As usual he introduced himself to the Arab tribes
when he met at Al-Agabah'" a number of the Khazraj on whom Allah
wanted to bestow goodness, On asking them he knew that they were of the

Khazraj and allies of the Jews. He politely invited them to sit with him und.
‘expounded to them Islam and recited the Qur'an to them. Allah had paved
the way for Islam in that they were living adjacent to the Jews, who were
from the People of the Book and they had knowledge, while they were
polytheists. They had conquered them in their land. And, whenever there
was any difference between the two parties, the Jews used to say to them,
“A Prophet who will be sent with a message is about to rise. We will follow.
him, and with him we will kill you as the people of “Ad and Lram were
killed.” So when the Messenger of Allah (pbuh) talked to them about Islam,
they said one to another, "Beware, by Allah, this is the very Prophet with
whom the Jews have threatened us; wherefore do not let them believe in
him before you." Thereupon they accepted his preaching and became
Muslims, saying. "There is no tribe that is xo divided by hatred and rancor
as our people awe, and may Allah bring them together through you. So let us
go and invite them to this religion of yours; and if Allah unites them in it, no
‘man will be mightier than you.”

They left the Prophet (pbuh) and went back to Madinah believing in
Islam. They were six from the Khaztaj. as 1 was told. Reaching Madinah,
they told their people about the Prophet (pbuh) calling them to embrace
Islam until it became widely spread among them. There was no house
belonging of the Angir but Islam and the Prophet (pbuh) had been
mentioned therein.

The First Pledge of Al-* Aqabah

The following year. on the occasion of the pilgrimage, there came a
group of twelve of the Angér who met him at Al-Agabah. This was the first
Pledge of Al Agabah, where they gave the Prophet (pbuh) a pledge in the
manner of the pledge of the women!" That had been before fight was
prescribed. Among those men were: As‘ad ibn Zurdrah. Rafiv ibn Malik,
‘Ubiidah ibnus-Simit, and Abul-Haythm ibn at-Tayyahdn. “Ubidah
ibmus-Samit reported, “I attended the first pledge of Al-Agabah. We were
twelve men pledging ourselves to the Prophet (pbuh) in the manner of the
pledge of the women, That had been before fight was prescribed. Thus. we
gave him our pledge that we will not associate anything in worship with

anything that Islam ordains. (The Prophet (pbuh) said to us,) Whoever fulfils
(his) will enter Paradise; and whoever commits any of these sins, it will be for Al-
Jah, Glorified und Exalted be He, Who may punish or forgive as He pleases."

Ibn Ishig said, "When those men left, the Prophet (pbuh) sent with them
Mus‘ab ibn “Umayr, the son of Hashim ibn “Abd Manaf, charging him to
show them how to recite the Qur'an, to teach them Islam, and to help them
understand the doctrines of their religion. In Madinah Mus*ab was called
“The Reciter” and he used to be their Imam in the prayers because the Aws
and the Khazraj could not stand that they take the lead of one another.

‘The Second Pledge of Al-’ Aqabah

During the pilgrimage season, Mus'ab returned to Makkah, along with
the Muslim Ansir who went to Makkah with their polytheist people to
perform the rituals of pilgrimage. They agreed to meet the Prophet (phish) at
night in the mid of Tashrig days (three days after the day of sacrifice) at a
hillock at Al-“Agabah, when Allah willed to honor them, help His Prophet
(pbub), and to strengthen Istam, Kab ibn Malik said,

“We set out with the polytheist pilgrims of our people, as we knew how
to pray and perform the rituals of the pilgrimage. Al-Bart’ iba Ma°rir, our
chief and master accompanied us, Travelling from Madinah, Al-Bara’ said,
‘Thave an opinion which 1 do not know whether you will approve of it or
nol. | propose to not let this building (the Ka’bah) bebind my back, so to
face it in prayers.’ We told him that according to our information the
Prophet (pbuh) used to direct his face towards Syria in prayers, and we did
‘not want to be different from him. He said, ‘I will offer prayer towards the
Ka'bah’ We retorted, ‘But we will not.’ At the time of prayers, we offered
them towards Syria whereas he offered them towards the Kabah until we
reached Makkah. We blamed him for his deed. but he refused and struck to
his view. Arriving at Makkah, he said to me, ‘O nephew, let us go to the
Prophet (pbuh) to ask him about what I have been doing throughout our
travel, for I feel some hesitation because you opposed me.’ Thus we headed

for the Prophet (pbuh). whom we did not know or see before, We asked a
‘man of Makkah about the Prophet (pbuh). He asked if we knew him and we
sald, ‘No’. ‘Then do you know his uncle Al~~Abbas ibn “Abdul-Muttalib? he
asked. We said "Yes,’ as he used to come to us as a merchant. He said,
"When you enter the Mosque be is the man who is sitting beside Al-- Abbi.”

We went to the Mosque where the Prophet (pbuh) was sitting next to
Al Abbiis. The Prophet (pbuh) asked Al“Abbis, ‘Do you know these two
‘men, O Abul-Fadl?” He said that he did and introduced us to him. 1 shall
never forget the Prophet's word when my name was mentioned, "The poet?”
ALBarii said, ‘O Prophet of Allah, I set out on this journey as a Muslim, for
Allah has guided me to Islam, { felt that I could not turn my back to this

‘Messenger of Allah? He replied, "You should! have kept 10 the (original) qiblah.’
Al-Bard’ returmed to the giblah of the Prophet (pbuh) and offered prayer
with us towards Syria. Then we went out to perform the pilgrimage, having
agreed with the Prophet (pbuh) to meet him at Al--Agabah in the mid of the
days of Tashrig.

In our company was “Abdullah ibn “Amr ibn Harim, who was a
polytheist chief and a notable in our people. We said to him, "You are one of
‘our masters and notables and We do not want that you should serve as fuel
for the fire in the future because of polytheism.’ Then we invited him to
embrace Islam and told him about our intention (o meet the Prophet (pbuh)
at Al Aqubah. Immediately he became a Muslim, witnessed Al- Agabah
with us, being a Nagib (leader),

We slept that very night among our people in the camps until when
third of the night had elapsed; we left stealthily to our appointment with the
Prophet (pbuh) as far as the gully nearby Al-Aqabah. We were
seventy-three men, and wo women, Nusaybah, the daughter of Ka'b and
‘Asmi, the daughter of “Amr”, We gathered together waiting for the
Messenger of Allah (pbuh) who came in the company of his uncle
Al- Abbas ibn “Abdul-Muttalib, who was still « polytheist, but he came to
corroborate him, He was the first to speak:

“O you people of Khazraj - the Arabs used to call the people of this arew
‘the Khazraj’, whether they were from the Khazraj or the Aws - you all know
the position that Muhammad holds among us. We have protected him from
our people as much as we could. He lives in honor and safety among his
people. He has chosen to join you, so if you think you can adhere to your
promise to him, and if you can protect him. from his enemies, then assume
the burden that you have undertaken. However, if you are going to
‘elinguish and betray him after his joining you, itis better to leave him now,
for he is safe where he is.’

We replied, "We have heard your words. You speak, O Messenger of
‘Allah, and take our pledge for yourself and for your Lord as you wish.’ The
Messenger of Allah (pbuh) started speaking. He recited from the Quran,
called them to worship Allah, and urged them to stick to Islam, and then
said, ‘I take your pledge that you debar me from whatever you debar your women
‘and children from. Al-Bari took his hand and said, Oh yes, we swear by

‘Abul-Haytham ibn at-Tayyahin interrupted saying, ‘O Messenger of Allah,

whomever you fight and 1 will make peace with whomever you make peace with.’

‘The Messenger of Allah (pbuh) also said to them, ‘Get me twelve leaders

‘Then he (pbuh) said, ‘Ga 10 vour camps.

AI-Abbiis ibn “Ubadah said, "By Allah. if you wish, we will fight the
people of Mina tomorrow with our swords.’ He retorted, 'We have not been
ordained to do so, s0 go back 10 your camps.’ So we returned to our beds and
slept until the morning.

‘The chiefs of Quraysh came in the morning to our dwellings and said, ‘O
people of Khasraj, we have been informed that you came to take
Muhammad from within us in order to make a pledge with him to fight
igainst us, By Allah, there is none of the Arabs whom we hate to be at war

that nothing of that had happened. They were true for they knew nothing
about it, We looked at each other.

‘The people left Mina and they carefully investiguted the information and
found it to be true. Thus. they went on pursuing any of our people so they
reached Sa'd ibn “Ubidah at Adhakhir as well as Al-Mundhir ibn “Amur,
who were both among the leaders. Al-Mundhir ibn “Amr managed to escape
while they caught Sa'd, binding his hands and neck with thongs of his girth,
bringing him back to Makkah, battering him on the way, and dragging him
by the hair, as he has thick hair. Sa'd reported, ‘As | was in their hands, a

‘and that very man went to them telling them that 1 was being beaten, calling
their names for protection and mentioning their ties. When they knew that

saved me.” So Sa°d was released."

Conditions of the Last Pledge of Al-* Aqabah

‘The pledge of fighting took place when the Prophet (pbub) received
from Allah permission to fight, which was comprised of conditions that was
not found in the first pledge of Al- Aqabah. Thus they gave a pledge to fight
against all sorts of people in the way of Allah and His Messenger, and he
(pbuh) promised those who were faithful to be rewarded with Paradise.
“Ubadah ibnus-SAmit said, "We gave a pledge to the Prophet (pbuh) that we
‘would listen and obey in times of plenty as well as in scarcity, under likable
and dislikable circumstances, and that we would not prefer ourselves to the
other Muslims, and that we would not disagree with those who are in
authority, and that we would speak the truth wherever we are, and that we
would never fear of the blame of the blamers.”

The Ordinance of Fighting

Prior to the pledge of Al-Aqabah, the Prophet (pbuh) was not allowed
to fight nor shed blood. He was commanded merely to propagate the
message of Allah, to endure harassment, and to forgive the ignorant. The
Quraysh were persecuting the Muslims, seducing some from their religion,
and exiling others from their land. Some migrated 10 Abyssinia, while
others to Madinah. At this point, the Quraysh had become insotent and
disrespectful towards Allah, belying His prophet, torturing and exiling
whosoever worshiped Him, believed in His Oneness, in His Prophet, and
clung to His religion. Allah commanded His Prophet (pbuh) to fight and to
protect himself against those who wronged and ill-reated them. The first
verse revealed on this issue, as “Urwah ibnuz-Zubayr and other scholars
reported, was:

Gi


<br><br><br>

Permission to fight is given to those (ive. believers against dis-
believers), who are fighting them, (and) because they (believers) have
‘been wronged, and surely, Allal is Able to give then: (believers) victory
Those who have been expelled from their homes unwith justice only be-
cause they said: ‘Our Lord is Allah,’ = For had it not been that Allah
checks one set of people by means of another, monasteries, churches,
synagogues, and mosques, wherein the Name of Allah is mentioned
‘much would surely have been pulled down, Verily, Allah will help those
who help His (Cause). Truly, Allah is Al-Strong. All-Mighty. Those

pleased with them all,

Afterwards, Allah sent down,

Muslims Permitted to Emigrate to Madinah

When Allah gave permission to fight and those Ansar of Madinah hud
given a pledge to support and help the Prophet (pbuh) and the Muslims in
the cause of Allah, the Prophet (pbuh) ordered his Companions. the
emigrants of his people, and the Muslims living with him in Makkah, to
emigrate to Madinah and join theit brethren, the Angir. He (pbuh) said, "Al-
ah, Glorified and Exalted be he. has made for you brothers and residence with
which you feel secure.” Hence they Went out in groups, whereas the Prophet
(pbuh) remained in Makkah waiting for his Lord’s permission to leave
Makkah for Madinah.

The Emigrants to Madinah

‘The first to emigrate to Madinah of the Prophet's (pbuh) Companions
from the Quraysh from Band Makhzdm was Aba Salamah ibn “Abdel-Asad.
“That was a year before the second pledge of Al-Aqabah, after returning
from Abyssinia (o stay with the Messenger in Makkah. He was ill-treated by
the Quraysh at the time When he knew about those of Madinah who had
embraced Islam, so he headed for Madinah,

‘Ab d Salamah was first followed by “Amir ibn Rabi‘ah with his wile
Layl 4. the daughter of Abo Hathmah, Then “Abdullah ibn Jabish emigrated
along with his family and his brother “Abd, who was known as Abo Ahmad,
‘Aba Ahmad was a blind poet and he used to tour Makkah from top to
bottom without anyone to lead him, Then “Umar ibnul-Khaitib emigrated
and “Ayyash ihn Abi Rabi'ah al-MakhzOmi and many succeeded them.

The Prophet (pbuh) Emigrates to Madinah

After his Companions had departed, the Prophet (pbuh) remained in
Makkah waiting for Allah’s command to let him emigrate, Only Aba Bakr

and “Alt of the Prophet’ (pou) Companions remained, while all departed,
except those imprisoned and those who had been captivated, Abdi Bakr was,
however, urging the Prophet (pbuh) to permit him to emigrate but he would
Says "Do mat be in a hurry: it may be thar Allah will make a companion for you:
‘Abd Bakr wished that it would be the Prophet himself

Ut became clear to the Quraysh that the Proptiet (pbuh) had people and
Companions not just outside their tribe but outside their land, Furthermore,
the Quraysh were worried about the emigration of his Companions to join
them, who had settled in a new homeland under the protection of the Ans,
So they feared that the Prophet (pbuh) would join them, and they knew thay
he would fight them. They gathered in Dar an-Nadwah, a house that
belonged to Qusayy ibn Kilab, where they used to make serious decisions
concerning their affairs. They gathered to discuss how to take effective steps
against the Prophet (pbuh), who had constituted a real threat for them,

thn “Abbis reported, "In the morning of the day of Az-Zahmah (crowd)
Which they had agreed to meet in 10 take a decision about the Prophet
(Pub), Satan came to them in the form of a handsome old sheikh wearing a
mantle standing at the door, He introduced himself as a man from Najd

Success 10 reach a sound opinion. He was invited to enter and there he found
the leaders of the Quraysh.

The debate began with the statement that Muliammad, having gained
supporters outside the tribe, might take them with a sudden attack. so the
meeting was to determine the best course to deal with him. One proposed
that they should put him in irons behind bars to await death meeting the
same fate-as that of the gone poets who were like him, such as Zuhayr and
An-Nibighah, and others. The sheikh objected to this proposal claiming that
news of his imprisonment would reach his adherents, who at once would
attack them and draw him out; then their numbers would continue wo
increase Pulting an end to the sovereignty of the Quraysh. They ought to
think of another plan. Another person advised exile, thus forgetting about
him being out of sight and they would be rid of him. Likewise, they could
regain thei social affairs to their previous state. The sheikh disapproved of
that plan too, He said that the Prophet (pbuh) enjoyed sweet speech, logical

reason, and heart-touching message, and that if he resided with some
Bedouin tribe he would win them over so that they would follow him. Then
he would entice them to attack the Quraysh in thei lund, seize power from
them, and finally he would be able to do what he liked with them, They
should rethink the matter.

At this point Abd Jabl came up with a plan which had not been
suggested before that. He said that a band of young. powerful, well-born
men, one from each tribe, should strike Muhammad simultaneously with
their sharp swords and kill him so thatthe responsibility of the blood-money
would lie upon all the clans, Band “Abd Manff would not be able to fight
them all and would have to accept whatever amount of blood-money
provided by them all. The sheikh affirmed, "He is right. This opinion is the
only one to follow." Reaching a decision, the attendees broke up the
‘meeting with full determination for immediate implementation.

‘Then Jibril was sent to the Prophet (pbuh), "Do not sleep tonight in your
usual bed.” When it became dark, they gathered at his door in vigil waiting
for the moment on which he would go to sleep so that they might fall upon
him. When the Prophet (pbuh) observed what was being carried out he said
to “Ali,

“Sleep in my bed, and cover yourself with my green Hadrami mantle.
Use it when sleeping and they will not be able to do anything distikable
tw you."

‘The Prophet (pbuh) himself used to cover himself in that mantle to sleep.

According to Muhammad ibn Ka'b al-Qurazi, “When they all stood at
the door, Abd Jahl said, ‘Muhammad claims that if you follow him, you will
be kings over the Arabs and the non-Arabs, so when you are to be
resurrected after your death, Gardens, simitar to those in Jordan, will be
made for you (a a reward), and in case you do not follow him you will be
slaughtered, and after death a fire will be made for you to be burnt
therewit

‘The Messenger of Allah (pbuh) came out of the room with a handful of
dust saying, ‘Ido say that. You are one of them.’ Then Allah made them not see
him. The Prophet (pbuh) began to cast the dust on their heads while reciting
the verses (starting with),



<br><br><br>

4 Va-Sin. By the Qurian, full of wisdom (ie. full of laws, evidences, and
proofs.»
to the verse,

And We have put a barrier before them, and a barrier behind them,
and We have covered them up, so that they cannot see.»

(Yasin; 1-9)

Finishing his recitation, ll men had dust on their heads, Then he
managed his way out.

Someone who was not among the group, asked them what they were
waiting for there. They replied that they were waiting for Muhammad. The
‘man said, "May Allah tur you down! Muhammad came out, put dust on the
head of each of you, and then headed for his own affairs. Do you not see
‘what has occurred to you? Every one of them put his hand on his head and
felt the dust on it. Then they looked inside to find “Ali in his bed covered
with the Prophet's (pbuh) mantle, They said, 'By Allah, it is Muhammad
wrapped with his mantle,” Hence they stayed in their place. In the morning,
“Ali woke up from the bed. Only then they recognized that the man spoke
the truth.”

{bn Ishaq said, “Aba Bakr was a wealthy man of means. When he asked
the Prophet's permission for him to emigrate, he (pbuh) answered, ‘Do not be
hasty: maybe Allah will grant you a companion.’ AbQ Bakr wished that the
Prophet (pbuh) meant himself. He got two camels, and tied them up in his
house feeding them with fodder making them ready for travel.”

*Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said, "The Messenger of Allah
(pbuh) usually visited Aba Bakr's house every day either in the early
morning or evening. However, on the day when he got permission for
emigration from Makkah, he visited us at noon, a time at which he was not
used to come. When he saw him, Abd Bakr knew that something had
happened. AbG Bakr gave him his seat. Only 1 and my sister Asma’ were
home, The Prophet (pbuh) told him to let go whoever was in the house.
‘These ate my two daughters and they will do nothing. | ransom you with
my father and my mother,’ said Ab0 Bakr. ‘Allah has permitted me to leave and

emigrate,’ he (pbuh) said. May I accompany you, O Messenger of Allah’
asked AbO Bakr. ‘Yes, he (pbuh) replied. By Allah, prior to that day 1 had
never Seen anyone weeping for joy as did AbO Bakr then. He said, ‘O
Prophet of Allah, these ate the two camels that I have prepared for this
(mission). They hired “Abdull3h ibn Argat, a polytheist, to show them the
Way, as they guve him their two camels to feed unti the assigned date.”

According to Ibn Ishiig. no one knew the exact time at which the Prophet
(pbub) emigrated except *Ali, Abi Bakr, and his family. The Prophet (pbuh)
told “Ali about his emigration commanding him to stay behind in Makkah to.
restore deposits which men had entrusted with the Prophet (pbuh), since in
Makkah whoever had something he feared about losing it had deposited it
with the prophet (pbuh), for he was known for his trustworthiness.

When the Prophet (pbuh) took the decision to depart, he went to Abd
Bakr and the two of them left by a small gate at the rear of the house
heading for a cave on a mountain below Makkah called Thawr. Abd Bakr
ordered his son “Abdullah to lend an ear to the people's sayings so as 10
report them by night with the day's news. He also commanded his mawld,
“Amir ibn Fuhayrah, to graze his flock by day and to bring them in by the
evening in the cave. Asma’, his daughter used to go to them at night with
food."

‘They spent three days in the cave. Unable to reach the Prophet (pbuh),
the Quraysh offered a hundred she-camels as reward for whoever would
ize him. Throughout the day “Abdullih listened to their conspiracies and
sayings concerning the Messenger of Allah (pbuh) and would report to them
at night. “Amir used to graze his flock with the shepherds of Makkah until
night fell and would then go to the cave where they drank their milk and
slew some. In the morning, when *Abdullih left them to return to Makkah,
“Amir would let the sheep walk over the same path to cover his traces. After
three days passed. when men's interest waned, the man whom they had
hired came with their camels and his. They took with them the food

Bringing two camels AbG Bakr gave the Prophet (pbuh) the better one to
ride, but he refused to do so, since the camel was not his. Abd Bakr
dedicated it to him but he (insisted t0) pay its price and bought it from him
against the same price that Abi Bakr had paid for it. They rode off. and Abt
Bakr took “Amir with him to serve them in their way.

Asma said, "When the Messenger of Allah (pbuh) and Abd Bake had

{bn Ishaq said that the route of their journey was as follows with the
uidance of “Abdullah ibn Argat: starting from below Makkah; along the
shore until crossing the road below “Usfin: then below Ama: after passing
Qudayd by way of Al-Kharrar then Ligf. Then they passed Madlajat Lagt,
down to Madlajat' Mabij, then Magi” Mahi, down 10 Marjihy from
Dhul-Ghadawayn, then the valley of DhO Kashr, then Al-Jadijid, then
Al-Ajrid. Then they went through Dha Salam from the vallry of A°da,
Madlajat Trihn. Then they passed by Al- Ababid, then Al-Fajjah.

‘mounts having dropped behind, a man of the Aslam, Aws ibn ‘Hajar’, took
the Prophet (pbuh) to Madinah on a camel of his called Ibnur-Ridi’, sending

At Quba’

“Abdur-Rahmin ibn “Uwaymir ibn S@idah said, "Men of my people
who were Companions of the Prophet's (pbuh) said to me, ‘When we knew
about the Prophet's departure from Makkah, we were eagerly awaiting his
arrival. After the Fajr prayers, we used to wait for him outside our lund. By
Allah. we did not leave the place until no more shade was left so we used to
return to our land: that was in the hot season. On the day of the Prophet's
arrival, We sat as usual until there was no more shade and then we entered
our houses. Afterwards, the Prophet (pbuh) arrived. A Jew was the first
Person to see him. He knew about our habit of waiting for the Prophet
(pbuh) to arrive. He yelled out at the top of his voice ‘O Band Quylah, your

of a palm-tree with Abd Bakr who was of the same age, Till then most of us
had never seen the Prophet (pbult). Crowds surrounded him without
knowing him from Abd Bakr. We knew him only when the shade
disappeared and Abd Bakr got up and shielded him with his mantle from the
sun heat.”

Ibn Ishdg said, “The Prophet (pbuh). stayed with Kulthdim ibn Hidm,
while others claim that he stayed with Sa'd ibn Khaythumah. Those of the
first view said that he used to leave Kulthdm to meet with the men in Sa°d's
house, who was a bachelor, lodging the Prophet's (pbuh) Companions of the
emigrants who were also bachelors, Abd Bakr resided with Hubayb ibn Isaf,
One said that he stayed with Kharijah ibn Zayd.

Alf ibn Abi Tilib stayed in Makkah for three days and nights until he
returned the deposits which the Prophet (pbuh) had been entrusted with.
Then, he joined the Prophet (pbuh) and lived with him at Kulthim's house.
‘The Prophet (pbuh) remained in Qui’ among Band “Amr ibn “Awf from
Monday to Thursday as he established the foundation of his mosque.

In Madinah

‘The Prophet (pbuh) left Qubd’ on Friday, as he offered the Friday prayer
among Band Salim ibn “Awf in the mosque at the bottom of the valley of
Ranund’. It was the first Friday prayer that he performed in Madinah,

“Itban ibn Malik and “Abbas ibn *Ubadah ibn Nadlah with some of Band
Salim ibn ~Awf came to the Prophet (pbuh) and said, "O Messenger of
Allah, abide by us.” He replied, “Let it (the she-camel) step forward freely, for it
{s commanded (by Aliah).” They did so, and when it reached the home of
Band Baya, he was received by Ziyad ibn Lubayd and Farwah ibn “Amr
with others of their tribesmen. They invited him but his answer was the
same as before. The camel continued with its slackened rein to Band
SWidah where Sa’d ibn “Ubadah and Al-Mundhir ibn “Amr told him the
same thing and he gave them the same reply. The whole thing was repeated
by Sa'd ibnur-Rabi', Kharijah ibn Zayd, and “Abdullah ibn Rawahah with

the mother of “Abdul-Muttalib, Salma, the daughter of “Amr, was one of
their women.

At last the she-camel stopped at the house of Band Malik ibnun-Najjar
as it knelt at the site of his future mosque, which was then used as a
rying-place for dates. The land was owned by two orphans of Band
AL-Najjar of Ban Malik clan, who were under the guardianship of Muvadh
ibn “Afra, Sahl and Suhayl, the sons of “Amr. He did not dismount until it
‘rose again, went forward, tumed back and then returned to kneel down in
its former spot. It shook and stretched itself on the ground, The Prophet
(pbuh) alighted and Abd AyyOb Khalid ibn Zayd carried his loggage into his
‘own house and the Prophet (pbuh) stayed with him. He (pbuh) asked about
the owners of the drying-place of dates. "It is owned by Sahl and Suhayl,
the sons of “Amt,” said Murdb ibn “Afra,” “and they are orphans in my
care. I can pay them for it, so you can build a mosque on it.

‘The Prophet (pbuh) ordered that a mosque should be built, and he lived
with Aba Ayyib until his mosque and residency were finished, The Prophet
(pbuh) worked with the Muslims in the construction to urge them to work.
The Muhdjirdn and the Ansir toiled hard. While building, they recited
verses in the meter: they mean,

‘There is no life but that of the next world.
© Allah, have mercy on the Ansir and the Mubijirdn,
‘The Prophet (pbuh) also said,

‘There is no life but that of the next world. O Allah, have mercy on the
Mubajirin and the Ansitr.

The Prophet (phuh) stayed with ABO Ayyib until his mosque and
fesidency were completed: then he went to his new home. AbO Ayyab
reported, "When the Prophet (pbuh) came to reside with me in my dwelling,
he occupied the ground floor. while 1 and Umm Ayydb (Aba Ayyilb’s wife)
were above. I said to him, 'O Prophet of Allah, I ransom you with my father

his hand in it. 1 rushed to him telling him of our habit and wondering why
that time the traces of his hand were not seen. He said that it was because of
the smell of the vegetables, as he should speak to people, and he said that
‘we might eat them. We did, but never sent him those vegetables again.”

Ibn Ishidq said that the Muhajirtn joined the Prophet (pbuli) one after the
other. None remained in Makkah except those who had been captivated or
imprisoned. Entire households with their possessions did not come together
except: Band Maz*dn from Band Jumah; Band Jabsh ibn Ri’ab, the allies of

Band “Adiyy ibn Ka"b. Because of emigration, their houses in Makkah were

Speeches and Pacts in Madinah

The Prophet's (pbuh) mosque and residency in Madinah took from the
month of Rabi'ul-Awwal to the month of Safar of the following year to be
built Almost all the Angr embraced Islam with the exception to Khatmah,
Wagif, Walil, and Umayyah who were from the Awsullah, a clan of the

‘Aws; these remained polytheist.

‘The first speech which the Prophet delivered, as reported on the
authority of Abd Salamah ibn “Abder-Rahiniin, was as follows. He (pbuh)

thanked and praised Allah with suitable words and said,

"Now then, O people, advance (good works) for yourselves. You know,
hhy Allah. one of you may be stricken leaving his flock without a shep
herd. Then Allah will ask him, with no interpreter or curtain that may
weil him from Him, ‘Did My Messenger not come to you and inform you
(My Message), and did 1 not bestow on you property and graces? So
what have you advanced for yourself?" Then he will tum right and left
cand see nothing, then he will look ahead and see nothing bur Hell,
Whoever can protect his face from the Hell-Fire even with half a date,
let him do s0; whoever does not find (this, or anything at all) then (let
‘him do it) with a good word; for with it (the good word) a good deed is
rewarded tenfold up to the double of seven hundred fold. Peace andl Al-
lah's mercy and blessings be upon you.

Inanother event the Prophet (pbuh) delivered a speech saying.

"Praise be to Allah Whom I praise and 1 beseech. We seek refuge with
Allah from the evils of ourselves and from our evil déeds, He whom Al-
lah guides none can mislead: and he whom He misleads nane can guide.
Lwitness that there is na god but Allah alone, with no partner. The best
speech is (that of) the Book of Allah, Glorified and Exalted be He. He is
successful the one whom Allah has made his adornment in his heart and
made him embrace Islam after disbelief. (He is the one) who has se-
lected it above all human speech, as it is the best and most eloquent
speech, Love what Allah loves. Love Allah with all your hearts. Never be

bored with the Words and Remembrance of Allah. Never let your hearts
bbe hardened towards i. Out of everything that Allah creates He chooses,
and selects. He has named the best of work”, and (has also named)
‘hase whuom He selected from among (His) servants, (and has assigned)
‘the useful speech, and the lawful and the prohibited from everything with
‘which people are provided. Thus, worship Allah and do not associate
anything with Him; be conscious of Him as He should be conscious of:
bbe true towards Allah with what your mouths say; and love one another
with the spirit of Allah among you. Verily, Allah becomes angry when
His covenant is breached. Peace be upon you."

‘The Prophet (pbuh) wrote a document concerning the Muhdjirin and the
Ansar in which he made an agreement with the Jews and let them deal
freely with regard to their religion and their wealth, and stated the mutual
obligations, The contents of the document were as follow:

“Abdullah ibn Abi Bakr related that when the Prophet stopped at Dhii
‘Tuwa, he was riding his beast wearing a turban of red Yemeni cloth, When
he saw how Allah had honored him with victory, he lowered his head in
humility to Allah until his beard almost touched the middle of the saddle.
Asma’ the daughter of Abd Bakr related that when the Prophet (pbuh) halted
in Dh Tuwa, Abd Quhafah asked one of his youngest daughters, to take
him up to Abd Qubays (a mountain in Makkah). He had almost lost his
Sight, so when they ascended he asked her what she could see. "A block of
blackness," she said. "It is the cavalry,” he said. Then she told him that she
was seeing a man running up and down in front of them. He said, "O
daughter, it is the adjutant,” i.e. the one who gives and forwards the orders
to the cavalry. Then she said, by Allah. the blackness has diffused.” He
said, “Therefore the cavalry has been set free. so hurry and escort me to my
house." While she was taking him down, the cavalry met them before
feaching his house. As the girl was wearing a silver necklace, a man
encountered her and tore it from her neck. When the Prophet (pbuh) entered
the Mosque, Abd Bakr went to him leading his father. On secing him the
Prophet (pbuth) said. "Why did you not leave the old man in kis house and let me
x0 w him there?” Aba Bakr replied, “It is he who should come to you". He
made him sit before him and stroked his breast and asked him to embrace
Islam and he did so, When Abd Bakr accompanied his father who was
white-haired, the Prophet (pbuh) told them to change that grayness of the
hair for him. Then AbO Bakr got up, held his sister's hand, and said, “L
implore by Allah and tstam for my sister's necklace”. No one answered him,
so he said, “O little sister, save the reward for your neckluce with Allah, for
honesty is rare among people nowadays.”

between his Companions of the Muhdjirin and the Angir, According (0
‘what has reached me, and I seek Allah's protection from attributing to him
words that he did not say, he said, "Be brothers in Allah, pair by pair.” He held
the hand of “Ali ibn Abi Talib and said, ‘This is my brother,’ The Messenger
‘of Allah, was the master of the Messengers and Imam of those who are
conscious of Allah. the Messenger of the Lord of the Worlds, and the
peerless and incomparable, He and “Ali ibn Abi Talib: became. brothers.

uncle of the Prophet, became the brother of Zayd ibn Harithah, the Prophet's

death. Ja°far ibn Abi Talib "the one of the two wings, and the flier (in
Paradise)" and Mu’Sdh ibn Jabal the brother of Ibn Salamah’ became
brothers.

white mule, I reached Al-Arik, as I thought I might find some woodcutters,
‘milkers, ur anyone who eould go to te people of Makkah to tell them about
the Prophet (pbuh) so that they could ask for protection before he entered
the place by force. While having such an intention, I heard the voice of Ab0
Sufyan and Budayl speaking to each other. Aba Sufyiin was saying, ‘I have
never seen such fires and camping before.’ ‘By Allah, it must be the
Khuza‘ah coming for war,’ answered Budayl. Abd Sufyfin said, The
Khuzii'ah are too trivial and few to have such fires and camps.’ Thus | knew
him by his voice as well as he did. I told him about the Prophet (pbuh) and
his army, and showed concem for him and for the Quraysh, ‘If he reaches
you he will cut off your head, so mount on the back of this mule and I will

‘companions went back.

Passing by the Muslim fires, they first became alert, wandering who we
‘were but calmed down saying that it was the Prophet's mule ridden by his

A Report on Those of the Prophet's Companions
Who Suffered from Fever:

*Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said, "When the Prophet
(pbuh) arrived at Madinah, it was the most place plagued with fever on
earth. It infected his Companions who suffered a severe affliction. Yet,
Allah kept it ftom His Prophet. Abi Bakr’s mawlds, “Amir ibn Fuhayrah

‘The coward's death comes upon him as he sits

Every man resists it with all his might

I said, ‘By Allah “Amir does not know what he is saying.’ Bilal, when the
fever swayed him, lay down on the ground of the house, and raised his voice
saying,

suspected that “AIT might have been fooling him and all what he had done
He said, "By Allah, I found nothing else to do,”

‘The Prophet (pbuh) gave orders to the Muslims to prepare for an
invasion, AbG Bakr was visiting his daughter “A'ishah who was making the
preparations. When be asked her about the place they were to go, she told
hhim that she did not know, Later the Prophet (pbuh) announced that he was
going to Makkah and ordered them to be ready. He said, "O Allah, take away
the spies and news from the Quraysh so that we may take them by. surprise in their
land.” The army got ready.

When the Prophet (pbuh) determined to march to Makkah, Hatib ibn Abi
Balta’ah wrote a message to the Quraysh to tell them about the Prophet's
decision to raid them. He gave it to a womai to whom he paid some money
to convey it to the Quraysh. She put it on her head, then plaited her braids
‘over it and left. The Prophet (pbuh) received a report from heaven of Hat
deed. Thus, he summoned “Ali ibn Abi Talib and Az-Zubayr ibnul--Awwém.
and said, "Go after a woman with whom there is a leer from Harib ibn Abi Bal-

her in Al-Khatiqah of Bani Aba Abmad. Making her get down, they looked
into her baggage but found nothing, “Ali swore by Allah to her that the
Prophet was never to be misinformed nor were they, and that if she did not
‘give the letter they would strip her. When she found him serious, she told
them to tum aside. She undid her braids and gave the letter to him. When
the Prophet (pbuh) got the letter from him, he called Hatib and asked him,
"Whar induced you to do so?” He said, “By Allab, 1 believe in Allah and His
Messenger and my belief has never changed. But I am a man of no position
among the Quraysh and T have children and a family there so I had to do
something for their sake." “Umar asked the Prophet to let him behead Hatib

‘When they attacked them at Al-Watir at night they killed Munabbah, a
man who had a weak heart. He told Tamim ibn Asad who accompanied
him, to flee for he was sure that he would die, whether they killed him of set
him free, since he had a problem in his heart. Hence, Tamim managed to
‘escape, while Munabbah was. caught and killed. On entering Makkah the
Khuza‘ah resorted to the house of Buday! ibn Warqa’ and that of an ally of
theirs called Rafi".

With the attacks of the Quraysh and Band Bakr against The Khuziah
killing some of them, they were in fact violating their treaty with the
Prophet (pbuh) through their aggressive attitude towards the Khuzd'ah who
were in bond with him. Under this situation, “Amr ibn Salim al-Khuea't and
‘one of Band Ka°b went to the Prophet (pbuh) in Madinah. That was among
the causes of the Conquest of Makkah, “Amr stood by him while he was
sitting with the people in the mosque, told him about the breach of the
pledge, and asked for help. The Prophet (pbuh) said, "You will get help,
“Amir ibn Salim” When a cloud appeared in the sky to him, he said, "Verily,
this cloud will pour down with the victory of Bani Ka’b.”

‘Together with a band of the Khuzi‘ah, Budayl ibn Warga’ went to the
Prophet (pbuh) in Madinah to inform him of their affliction and how the
Quraysh were supporting Bani Bakr against them, After meeting him they
returned to Makkah, The Prophet (pbuh) had said to them, "It seems that vou
will see Abii Sufviin coming to reinforce the treaty and extend its term." When
Budayl and his companions had reached “Usfin they met AbO Sufyan ibn
Harb, who had been dispatched by the Quraysh to reinforce the treaty with
the Prophet (pbuh) and to make an extension, as they feared the outcome of
what they had done. When Ab0 Sufyan saw Budayl, he asked him from
where he was coming, as he suspected that he bad been to the Prophet
(pbuh). He answered that he hisd been moving with the Khuzi'ah along that
coast and at the bottom of that valley, while he denied that he had been to
Muhammad (pbuh), when he had asked him so. Budayl had continued to
Makkah, and Abd Sufyain did not believe him as he said to himself, "In case
Budayl went to Madinah fe would have foddered his camels date-seeds to

with it until when he was in the heart of the battle with no way out, he
alighted his roan horse, hamstrung it, and resumed fighting until he was killed,

Thn Hishdm said, "A scholar whom [ trust told me that Ja°far held the
standard first in his right hand, but it was cut off, so he seized it with his left
hand which was also cut off. Then he clasped it «0 his breast with bis aris
until he was killed. He was thirty-three years of age. Consequently, Allah
rewarded him with two wings in Paradise with which he flew wherever he
wistied. It was said that a Roman warrior struck him, cutting hima sunder.”

Thn Ishiq said that after the killing of Ja°far, “Abdullah ibn Rawahah
held the standard and stepped forward with it while riding his horse. He had
to repress himself as he felt hesitant to proceed, but he blamed himself and
got off. Then his cousin offered him a meat bone, saying, "Support yourself
with this, for you have suffered a lot in these difficult days.” He took a little
bite, but when he heard the sounds of disorder and crowd in the army, he
hurled it away, saying to himself, "Are you (still living) in this world?” He
gripped his sword, advanced, and fought until he was killed. Then Thabit
ibn Agram the brother of Band Al-"Ajlin took the standard. He cried out,
"O Mustims, come together round a man of you.” They said, "You (be this
man)," But he abjected so they rallied to Khalid ibnul-Walid, As he took the
standard, he parried the enemy to avoid an encounter. Then he withdrew and
the enemy averted from him until he retreated with the army.

According to what has reached me, when the army was crushed the
Prophet (pbuh) said, “Zayd held the standard and fought with it until he was
killed as a martyr; then Ja'far took it and fought with it until he was killed as a
martyr.” Then he (pbuh) kept silent, so the faces of the Ansar changed color
for they thought that some mischief had happened to “Abdullah ibn
Rawabah. Yet he continued, “Then “Abdullah ibm Rawahah held it and fought
with it until he was killed as a martyr." Then he said, “They were carried up to
‘me in Paradise. as I saw in a vision. on beds of gold. saw “Abdullah's bed turning
aside from the beds of his two fellows (i.e. Zayd and Jafar). When I asked for the
reason. I was told that thes moved on (without hesitation) bur he wavered before

mention it to anyone.” Al-Abbis then met Al-Walid ibn “Utbah who was
his friend. He informed him about it but asked him to keep it a secret. Yet
Al-Walid told his father and the story prevailed in Makkah so that the
Quraysh were speaking about it in their public assemblies. Al- Abbis said,
“Lwoke up in the morning to circumambulate the House, whereas Abi Jahl
was sitting with a group of the Quraysh discussing “Atikah’s vision. When

“Urwah said that when Az-Zubayr ibnul- Awwam emerged to fight Yasir,

Kill him, if Allah wills.” Az-Zubayr went out and killed Yasir.

Salamah ibn “Amir ibnul-Akwa’ related, "The Prophet (pbuh) sent Aba
Bakr with the standard against some of the Khaybar strongholds, He fought
until he became exhausted and returned without a conquest. Afterwards, he
sent “Umar but with the same results. The Prophet (pbuh) said, "Zomorrow 1
will give the banner to a man who loves Allah and his Messenger. Allah will over-
come it with his hands. and he never escapes.” Hence the Prophet (pbuh)
summoned "Alf who had had a problem in his eye at that time, so he (pbuh)
spat in his eye and said, "Take this stundand and proceed with it, until Allah
grants you vietory.”

‘Salamah said, "Ali harried away with it, gasping as he rushed, while we
were behind him following his traces until he fixed the standard in a pile of
stones under the fortress, From the topmost part of the fortress, a Jew
looked down at him and asked, “Who are you?” He replied, “I am “Ali ibn

sent to MGs!" He did not return unti! Allah had made the conquest through
his hands. The two strongholds of Khaybar, Al-Watib and As-Suldlim were

When the people of Fadak knew that they had done so, they sent to the

‘Muhaysah ibn Mas'0d, the brother of Band Harithah, was among the
mediators. The people of Khaybar asked for surrender and that the Prophet
(pbuh) would Jet them undertake their property against a half share of the
‘output, saying, "We know it better than you and we are better growers.” The
Prophet (pbuh) accepted their proposal but stipulated that "If we wish ro exile
‘you, we will do it." He made a similar reconciliation with the people of
Fadak. Thus, Khaybar conceded to the Mustims, while Fadak was fully for

Az-Zuhri said that no previous vietory was greater than this. It was only
fighting when people met; however. when there was an armistice instead of
war, people felt secure, sat together, and negotiated to settle disputes. Thus,
none rationalized what was said concerning Islam but embraced it, In those
two years as many embraced Islam as ever before, perhaps more."

The March to Khaybar in Al-Muharram, 7 AH

After his return from Al-Hudaybiyah, the Prophet (pbuh) spent
Dhul-Hijjah and part of Al-Mubarram in Madinah, while the polytheists
were in charge of pilgrimage, Then in the remainder of Al-Muharram he set
forth against Khaybar. Abo Mu’altib ibn “Amr related, “When the
Messenger of Allah oversaw Khaybar he said to his Companions, while |
‘was among them, ‘Stop’. Then he said, ‘0 Allah, Lont of the heavens and what
they overshadow, Lord of the lands and what they make to sprout, Lord of the dev-
is and what they lead astray. Lord of the winds and what they winnow! We ask
You the goodness of this town, the goodness of its people, and the goodness of what
isin it. We seck Your refuge from its evil. the evil ofits people, and the evil of what
{sin it, Proceed in the name of Allah’ That was what he used to say on entering
every town.”

Anas ibn Malik related, "The Messenger of Allah (pbuh) used to make
his raids in the morning. If he heard the call to prayer he would not advance,
and if he did not hear it he would raid, We reached Khaybar at night, and
the Prophet (pbuh) spent the night there. In the moming as he did not hear the
call to prayer, he rode and we rode with him, and I was riding behind Abd
‘Talhah with my foot touching the Prophet's. We met the laborersof Khaybar
in the morning with their spades and baskets, On seeing the Prophet (pbuh)
‘and the army they yelled, "Muhammad with his army,” and turned tail and
escaped. The Praphet (pbuh) said, “Allahu Akbar! Khaybar is destroyed. When
we alight in a people's yard. it is a bad morning for those who are warned.'”

‘Then the Prophet (pbul) halted near Badr. He rode on with one of his
‘Companions until he met an old Bedouin. He asked him about the Quraysh
as well as about Mubammad and his Companions, and whether he had any
information about them. The old man stated, “I will not tell you until you
tell me which of the two you are.” The Prophet (pbuh) retorted, “If you an-
wer us, we will tell you.” He said, "Tit for tat?" "Yes", he replied. The
Bedouin said. "I have heard that Muhammad and his Companions moved on
such-and-such a day. If that is right, they today should have: reached
such-and-such a place. (referring to where the Prophet (pbuh) actually was).
Also I heard that the Quraysh marched out on such-and-such a day, so today
they should have been in such-and such a place,” where they actually were.
When he had finished he said, "Where did you come from?” The Prophet
(pbuh) said, "We are from ma*”’.” Then he departed, while the old man was
Saying, "What does this mean? Is he from the Ma’ of Iraq?”

‘Then the Prophet (pbuh) went back to his Companions, In the evening,
he sent “Ali ibn Abi Talib, Az-Zubayr ibnul Awwam, and Sa'd ibn Abi
Waggas with a number of the Companions to the well at Badr in search of
news. where they seized some of the Quraysh water-men, among whom
were Aslam of Bani Al-Hajiaj. and “Arid Abd) Yasér of Band Al- As ibn
Sa’id. They caught them and inquired of them while the Prophet (pbuh) was
performing prayer, They said. "We are the water-men of the Quraysh; they
sent us to bring them water.” The people did not like their answer, as they
hoped that they belonged to Abd Sufydn. Thus, they beat them severely
until the two claimed that they belonged to Abdi Sufydn. So they released
them. When the Prophet (pbuh) finished his prayers. he said, "When they told
sow the truth you beat them; and when they lied vou released them? They spoke the
truth for they belong to the Quraysh. Inform me (you two) what about the Que
raysh?® They retorted, "They are behind this dune which you see on the
Femotest embankment.” The Prophet (pbuh) asked them about their number
and they said that they were many but they did not know their exact
number; hence he inguired of them about the number of beasts they
sacrificed each day. When they said nine or ten, he said, "The people ure be-

to write that. Then he said, "Write down This is what Muhammad, the Mes-
senger of Allah has reconciled with Sukayl ibn “Amr.” Suhyal objected, “If 1
witnessed that you are Allah's Messenger, I would not fight you, Write your
‘own name and your father's.” The Prophet (pbuh) said,

"Write ‘This és what Muhammad ibn “Abdullah has reconcited with Su-
hay! ibn “Amr. They have agreed to stop all fighting for ten years, during
which time the people will tive safely, restraining from animosities on
condition that in case anyone xoes to Muhammad without his guardian's
permission, he will send him back to them: and in case that anyone of
Muhanunad’s followers goes to the Quraysh they will not seng him back
10 him. We will not show hostility one to another and there will be no
theft or treachery. He who wishes to enter into a covenant and agree-
‘ment with Muhammad may do s0 and he who wishes to enter ino a cov-
‘enant and agreement with the Quraysh may do so."

‘The Khuza’ah chose to enter into a bond and agreement with the Prophet
(pbuh), while Band Bakr chose the Quraysh and said fo the Prophet (pbub),
“You should keep back from us this year, not enter Makkah against our will.
As for the next year, we will leave it for you to spend three nights with your
‘Companions. Thereupon, you may bring with you nothing more than riders!
‘weapons and swords in sheaths,”

While the Prophet (pbuh) and Suhayl were writing the agreement, AbO
Jandal ibn Suhayl ibn “Amr suddenly showed up in fetes, having fled to
the Prophet (pbuh). The Prophet's Companions left and they did not doubt
the conquest of Makkah, for they depended on a vision (dream) which the
Prophet (pbuh) had seen. When they saw the talks for peace and withdrawal
taking place and what the Prophet (pbuh) had endured, they were extremely
depressed almost to the point of death. When Suhayl saw Abd Jandal, he
slapped him on the face and gripped his collar, saying, "0 Muhammad, the
issue between us was resolved before this man arrived to you.” He agreed,
Suhayl pulled him violently by his collar and drew him away to send him
back to the Quraysh, while AbO Jandal yelled with all his strength, "O
Muslims! Am I to be sent back to the polytheists to seduce me from my
religion?” This augmented the people's grief. The Prophet (pbuh) said,

a dense surface which did not prevent the Prophet's movements, but
severely confined the movements of the Quraysh. ‘The Prophet (pbuh)
hurried to the water. Getting to the proximal water of Badr, he settled down.

Al-Hubab ibnul-Mundhir said, “O Messenger of Allih, is this the spot
which Allab has inspired you to occupy. so that we cannot move {rom it, or
is it'a matter of stratagem of war and the product of consultation?” When
the Prophet (pbuh) said that it was a stratagem of war and consultation,
Al-Hubab pointed out, "His not a good place to stop in. Let us continue and
encamp by the nearest welll of water and make a cistern full of water, and
destroy the other wells; then we can fight our enemy who will have nothing
to drink.

‘The Prophet (pbuh) approved of his excellent plan which was
immediately carried out; the wells were destroyed: a cistern was constructed
and filled with water from which his men filled their: drinking-vessels,

‘Sad ibn Mu adh said, “O Prophet of Allah, jet us make « hut for you to
Stay in, having your riding beasts await; then we will go on fighting the
enemy and if Allah grants uy victory, that is what we wish; if it is defeat,
you could ride your camels and go back to Madinah to our people who are
Jeft behind, for they love you as much as we do. If they knew that you
would go to war they would not have remained behind. Allah will protect
you with them; they will give you good advice and strive in the cause of
Allah with you." The Prophet (pbuh) praised him and prayed to Allah for
his ood. Then a trellis was built for the Prophet (phuh) and he stayed there.

Having moved in the moming. the Prophet (pbuh) saw the Quraysh
approaching from the “Agangat dune into the valley, he exclaimed,

“0 Alla, here isthe Quraysh coming tn their conceit und haughtiness
‘challenging You anil belving Your Messenger. O Allah, grant me victory
which You have promised. O Allah, destroy them this morning!”

When the Quraysh settled down, a number of them, among whom was
Hakim ibn Hizdim, went to the Prophet's basin to drink. The Prophet (pbuh)
Jet them drink, but whoever drank of it on that day was slain with the
exception to Hakim who later became a devout Muslim and used to say.
when be was fervid in his oath, “By Him Who reseued me on the Day of Badr.”

‘The Prophet (pbuh) told him the same words that he had said to those
wio hud come before him, namely, that he had not come to fight against
them. He left the Prophet (pbuh) after seeing how the Muslims treated him.
Whenever the Prophet (pbuh) finished his ablution, they ran after him to
‘oblain the water he had utilized; if he expectorated they hurried to it; and in
‘case a hair fell from his head they rushed ta pick it up. Hence he returned to the
Quraysh saying, "I have been to Chosroes, Caesar, and Negus in their
kingdoms, but never have T seen a king among his people ike Muhammad among
his Companions. They will never leave him in any case, so make up your mind.”

‘The Prophet (pbuh) sent Khiraish ibn Umayyah al-Khuzi'i to the
Quraysh in Makkah, and made him ride one of his camels called
Ath-Tha'lab, to tell their notables the reason for his coming. However, they
hamstrung the Prophet's camel and were about to slay the man, but the
blacks protected him and released him, so that he returned safely to the
Prophet (pbuh),

Afterwards whea the Prophet (pbuh) summoned “Umar to convey the
same message to Makkah, ‘Umar told him he felt that they would kill bim,
especially no one from Band “Adiyy ibn Ka'b was in Makkah to defend
him, and the Quraysh were aware of his animosity and rudeness towards
them. He recommended that be should dispatch a man who was dearer to
them than himself and he named “Uthmdn ibn “Affan. The Prophet (pbuh)
sent “Uthniin to Abd Sufydn and the celebrities of the Quraysh to inform
them that he had not come for war but only as a visitor to the Inviolable
House and to glorify its sanctity.

As he was about to enter Makkah, “Uthman met Abin ibn Said
ibnul-As who drove him in front of him. He further provided him with
protection until he reported the Prophet's message to them. After stating the
whole message, they said to him, “If you wish to circumambulate the
House, do so.” He answered that he would not until the Messenger of Allah
(pbuh) could also do so. The Quraysh imprisoned him and the Prophet
(pbuh) and the Muslims were told that “Uthmin had been slain.

brother.” “Amir yelled, "Alas for “Amr! Alas for “Ame!” War was stired up,
all were infuriated, the people held steadfastly to their evil cause, while
“Utbah’s advice was left unheeded.

Al-Aswad ibn “Abdel-Asad al-MakhaGmi, a fierce bad-tempered man,
stepped out swearing, “I swear by Allah that I will surely drink from their
cistern or demolish it or die before reaching it.” Hamzah ibn
“Abdel-Muttalib engaged with him, and struck him, sending his foot with
half of his shank flying. He fell on his back and his foot was streaming with
blood towards his friends. He scrambled to the cistern and threw himself
aiming to fulfil his oath, but with another blow Hamzah killed him in the cistern.

“Usbah ibn Rabiah came out between bis son Al-Walid and his brother
Shaybah, from the lines of the Quraysh and called for a duel with the
Muslims, Three young men of the Angir stood against him: *Awf and
Mu*awwidh the sons of Al-Harith and “Abdallah ibn RawShah. When the
‘Quraysh knew that they were from the Angir, they said they had nothing to
do with them. Thereafter one of them heralded, “O Muhammad! Let our
equals of our people come against us!" The Prophet (pbuh)
O ‘Ubaydah ibnul-Harith, come on, O Hamzah, and come on O°Ali-

Coming closer to them, the Quraysh asked, “Who are you?" After each
‘had introduced himself, they said, “Yes, our equals and most honorable.”
“Ubaydah, their eldest, dueted with *Uthah ibn Rabi'ah while Hamzah went
against Shaybah ibn Rabf'ah and ° Alf against Al-Walid ibn ° Utbah. It was
not long before Hamzah killed Shaybah and “AIT killed Al-Walid. Striking
each other, “Ubaydah and “Utbah were seriously wounded. Then Hamzah
and “Ali struck “Utbah with their swords and slain him. They carried their
friend back to his people.

The two parties moved forward closer to each other. The Prophet (pbuh)
had commanded his Companions not to attack until he gave the order, and if
they were encircled by the enemy, they were to resist them with showers of
arrows. He himself remained in the hut with Aba Bakr, The battle of Badr
took place on Friday moming on the seventh of Ramadan,

‘The Prophet (pbuh) straightened the Lines and then again stayed in the
hut with Abd Bakr. The Prophet (pbuh) was appealing to Allah for the

they had done so, he said, “By Allah, this ix the (saying) ‘Forgive us’ which was
‘ordained on the Children of Israel, but they did not say it.”

‘The Prophet (pbult) gave orders to travel towards the right, through salty
growth, on the way leading to the spot of Thaniyyat al-Murir onto the slope
of Al-Hudaybiyah below Makkah,

‘When the cavalry of the Quraysh noticed the dust of the Muslims’ forces
and that they had averted them, they galloped back to their Quraysh, When
the Prophet (pbuh) reached Thaniyyat al-Murar, his she-camel knelt down.
‘The men believed that it would not get up. The Prophet (pbuh) commented,

"lt has never been stubborn, as itis not its nature, but it has been with:
held by what restrained the elephant from Makkah. Today I shall accept
whatever plan through which the Quraysh ask me to confirm kindred
ties.”

‘Then he told the people to descend. They hesitated at first, for there was

‘no water at which they could stop. Thus, the Prophet (pbuh) took an arrow

from his quiver and gave it to one of his Companions to prod in the middle

of a water hole. The water thereafter gushed out until the men and their

‘camels had drunk to their fill, They encamped there.

While the Prophet (pbuh) was staying there, Budayl ibn Wari
al-Khuza'i came with some men of the Khuzi'ah asking him about the
reason for his coming. He told them that it was not for war but to visit and
venerate the Sanctuary. Then he repeated what he had said to Bishr ibn
‘Sufyan. When they conveyed his words to the Quraysh, they suspected them
and were rude to them, saying, "Even if he is not coming for war, by Allab,
he shall never enter it against our desire, nor shall the Arabs ever utter that
‘we have accepted it.”

‘The Khuzi’ah tribe, Muslims and polytheists, were confidants of the
Prophet, always keeping him informed of everything that was taking place
in Makkah, When the Prophet (pbuh) saw Mikras iba Hafs ibnul-Akhyat
‘who was sent by the Quraysh, he said, "This is a treacherous man!” When he
approached and spoke to him, he answered him with the same words as he
had said to Buday) and his companions. Mikras returned to the Quraysh

Prophet (pbuh) saying, "Here is the head of the enemy of Allah, Abd Jahl.”
He said, “tty Allah ether than Whom there is no god, is 12° "Yes," Yon Mas’d
said, throwing his head belore the Messenger of Allah (pbuh), who then
praised Allah the Almighty.

When the Prophet (pbuh) commanded that the corpses should be all cast
into a pit, all were thrown with the exception of that of Umayyah ibn Khalaf
which had swelled within his armor to the extent that it filled it, When they
tried to carry his corpse. it disintegrated, so they left it where it was and
heaped earth and stones on it.

Afier throwing the corpses into the pit. the Companions heard the
Prophet (pbuh) at midnight saying. "O people of the pit. “Utbah ibn Rabt‘ah,
uybah thn Rabi'ah, Umayyah ibn Khalaf, Aba Jahl, ~ and he counted out those
in the pit, - have you found trie what your Lord had promised vou, for I have
deed found true what my Lord had promised me?" His Companions said, “O
Messenger of Allah, are you talking to the dead?” He said, “They can hear me
‘more than you bua they cannot answer.”

Afterwards the Prophet (pbuh) ordered to bring together all the spoils of
war that had been collected in the eamp. ‘The Muslims disputed over them.
‘The group which had collected them thought they were theirs; the warriors
who pursued the enemy claimed that they were the cause for getting them;
while the guards who escorted the Prophet (pbuh) to defend him from the
enemy, claimed that they had wanted to collect the spoils but they feared
that the enemy might return, so they kept their position with the Prophet
(pbuh).

Then the Prophet (pbuh) dispatched “Abdullah ibn Rawahah with the
news of victory to the people of Upper Madina, and Zayd ibn Harithah to
the people of Lower Madinah, Then the Prophet (pbuh) began his journey
back to Madinah with the disbelieving captives, among whom were “Ugbah
iba Abi Mut and An-Nadr ibnul-Harith,

‘Then the Prophet (pbuh) advanced until he reached the pass of As-Satta’
Where he stopped on the sand hill hetween the pass and An-Naziyah where
he equally divided the spoils which Allah had granted to the Muslims. He
traveled to Ar-Rawha’ where the Muslims congratulated him and the

separate them, so they lived together as Muslim and disbeliever, until the
Prophet (pbuh) emigrated. Abul-’As joined the Quraysh on the Day of Badr
but he was seized among the captives and taken to Madinah with the
Prophet (pbuh). When the Quraysh sent to redeem their prisoners, Zaynab
sent money to ransom her husband and the money included a necklace
Which her mother, Khadijah, had given her on her wedding. When the
Prophet (pbuh) saw the necklace his feelings became greatly tender and he
said (to his Companions), “If you would think that you set ker captive husband
free and repay her money, do so.” They accepted and did so,

‘Thus. Abul-“As lived in Makkah, while Zaynab lived in Madinah with
the Messenger of Allah (pbuh), Abul- Ag went to Syria as a merchant with
his wealth and that which the Quraysh had entrusted him with. as he was a
reliable man. On his way back. he was attacked by a Mustim raid which
took his merchandise, but he managed to run away. When the raiders went
away with their booty, Abul-As went to Zaynab's house in the night,
seeking her protection as well as the return of his property.

While the Prophet (pbuh) with the Muslims was performing the morning
prayer, Zaynab cried out from among the women, “O people, I have given
protection to Abul-"As ibnur-Rab?.” After the prayer. the Prophet (pbuh)
made sure that the people had heard Zaynab's declaration and added, “By
Him in Whose hands is Muhammad's soul, I haa known nothing (about the matter)
hefore hearing what you have heard. The Muslims can protect whoever is lower
than them.” He afterward headed for his daughter and said to her, "Make his
stay comfortable, but do not tet him touch you, since you are not lawful for him."

According to “Abdulla ibn Abi Bakr, the Prophet (pbuh) sent to those
who raided Abul-As saying, “This man as you know is our relative, and you
have taken his property. If you do a charitable act and restore him his property, we
like you to; if not, it isa booty which Allah has bestowed on you, and you have the
better right to it.” They expressed their will to return it. They were so keen to
restore everything and not to withhold anything. Abul-As went to Makkah
to pay all the dues to the Quraysh, making sure that no one had any further
claim on him, "No," they said, "May Allah reward you; you have been both
honest and generous.” "Therefore". said he. “I bear witness that there is no
god but Allah and that Muhammad is His Servant and His Messenger. By
Allah, nothing delayed me from embracing Islam but that I feared you

Back to his comrades at the end of the night, Aba Sufydn sent some
Qurayshis to Madinah. Ina place called Al Urayd, they set fire to a bunch
‘of palm-trees and killed a man from the Ansir with his ally while working
in the fields. People knew about them, so the Prophet (pbuli) pursued them,
leaving his place in Madinah to Bashir ibn “Abdel-Mundhir. He reached
Qargaratul-Kudr but returned because Abd Sufyan and his group had
escaped. They found that the raiders had discarded some of their items in
the fields to lighten their load so they could run swiftly, On their return, the
Muslims asked the Prophet (pbuh), "O Messenger of Allah, do you think
that this will be counted (to Allah) for us as an invasion?” "Yes", he
answered.

The Invasion of Dha Amarr

After the As-Sawiq invasion, the Prophet (pbuh) remained in Madinah
for nearly the rest of Dhul-Hijjah, and then he set forth to Najd, aiming at
Ghiataffn. This was the Invasion of Pho Amarr. Spending nearly all the
month of Safar in Najd he went back to Madinah without any fighting. He
stayed in Madinah almost all the month of Rabi'ul-Awwal

The Invasion of Al-Furu* of Bahran.

Putting Ton Umm Maktdm in charge of Madinah, the Prophet (pbub)
‘went out for the Quraysh reaching Bebrin, a mine in Al-Furu? in the Hija.
He spent two months there then returned to Madinah without fighting.

would reveal Qur'anic verses about me to he recited in the mosques and
prayers, Yet, I hoped that the Messenger of Allah would see a vision in his
sleep by which Allah would free me from such a lie, for He knows about my
innocence, or that there would be some sort of report. To send down some
Quranic verses about me, by Allah, I believed that T was too insignificant
for that.

‘Toring to my parents, 1 asked them, ‘Why do you not answer the

in tears again saying. ‘I will never repent to Allah of what you have said. By

‘And by Allah, the Prophet (pbuh) was still in his place when a revelation
came to him from Allah, He was wrapped in his robe, whereas 1 put a
leather pillow under his head, When I saw this I did not feel frightened, as I
was sure of my innocence and that Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He)

He went to the people and spoke to them, reciting the Quranic verses which

Jahsh, the most express slanderers be flogged with the ordained stripes."

‘And, on “Ubadah’s attitude of taking Allah, His Messenger, and those who

The Expedition of Zayd ibn Harithah
to Al-Qaradah Across the Waters of Najd

The Quraysh were afraid to pursue their usual road to Syria after the
Battle of Badr, so they took the road to Iraq. Some of their tradesmen went
‘out, including Abii Sufyiin, carrying a large amount of silver which
constituted most of their trade. They appointed Furit ibn Hayyan from Band
Bakr ibn Wail as a guide to that route. At once the Prophet (pbuh) sent
Zayd, who intercepted them by the watering place of Najd and captured the
caravan with its goods, but the men fled. He brought the booty to the
Prophet (pbuh).

"May Allah forgive you! People were speaking ill of me and you mentioned
nothing of it! She answered, “My little daughter, do not exaggerate the

having rival wives, and rumors circulate around her.

The Prophet (pbuh) delivered a speech which I was unaware of. After
praising Allah he said,

in Sald supported the Prophet's (pbuh) opinion,
not to go out to fight them, The Prophet (pbuh) did not like to fight outside
Madinah, but some Muslims whom Aliah honored with martyrdom at Ubud
and others who did not attend Badr said, "O Messenger of Allah, let us 20
forth to our enemies, otherwise they will think that we are cowards and
weak to fight them.” Ibn Salil suid, "O Messenger of Allah. stay in
Madinah. and do not turn to them. It has never been that we went forth to
fight an enemy but we have been defeated, and none has come here against
tus but have been vanquished, Thus leave them in their place. If they stay. it
will be the worst entanglement, while if they enter Madinah, men will fight
them, women and children will hurl them with stones from the walls, and if
they retreat, they will be feeling disappointed as they came."

With the persistence of those who were eager to fight the Quraysh, the
Prophet (pbuh) went into his house and was armored. That was on Friday
after prayer. On that day, Malik ibn “Amr of the Ansir from Band
An-Najjir died. After offering prayer over the dead Ansiri, the Prophet
(pbuh) headed for war. Meanwhile, the people blamed themselves for
pressing on the Prophet (pbuh) to fight against his will, which they had no
right to do, so when he came out to them they admitted that if he wished to
stay in Madinah they would not oppose him, The Prophet (pbuh) remarked,
“Ieis not appropriate for a Prophet who has put on his armor to take tt off until he
has fought." He set forth with a thousand of his Companions, until they
reached Ash-Shaw{ between Madinah and Ubud, where “Abdullah ibn
Ubayy seceded with a third of the warriors, saying, "He (the Prophet) has
‘obeyed them and disobeyed me. We do not know why we should kill
ourselves here, O men.”

So he withdrew with his followers who were hypocrites and doubters.
Abdullah ibn “Ami ihn Harim followed them saying, “O people, I beseech
you by Allah not to forsake your people and your Prophet while the enemy
is nearby.” They answered, “If there should be a fight we would not
relinquish but we do not think that there will be a war.” When they persisted.
‘on withdrawal, he said, "May Allah deport you, you enemies of Allah, for
Allah will make His Prophet dispensable of you.” On that day the Ansar
asked, "O Messenger of Allah, should we not seek the support of our Jewish
allies?" He said." We have no need of them.”

replied, 1 will fulfil your debt and marry vou." She said yes and they were
‘married. When the people heard that the Prophet (pbuh) had married
Juwayriyul, Band Al-Musualiq became the Prophet's relatives by marriage,
So they emancipated those they held. Hence, a hundred families were set
free by this marriage. I have never known a woman who so great a blessing
to her people than she was.”

From Yazid ibn Ramin, the Prophet (pbuh) dispatched Al-Walid ibn
“Ugbah ibm Abi Mu'ays to them after they had embraced Islam, When they
heard that he was coming, they went out to meet him, but when he knew
that they were coming, he became frightened so he returned to the Prophet
(pbuh) telling him that they were going to kill him and thus had detained
their alms. The Muslims were indulged in talk to invade them until the
Prophet (pbuh) himself was about to do so, In the middle of this, a
delegation of theirs went to, the Prophet (pbuh) saying, “O Messenger of
Allah, we heard of your envoy whom you sent, so we went out to honor him
and to pay due alms, but he turned back as rapidly as he could. Then we
were told that he alleged that we intended (o slay him. By Allah, we did not
‘come out for that.” So Allah sent down on this incident,

tests except in such situation (i.e. war in the cause of Allah)."

Ab@ Sufyan said to the standard bearers of Band “Abdud-Dar, spurring
them to war, °O Band “Abdud-Dar! You have been assigned to bear our
standard on the Day of Badr and you know what has happened. The
standard is the first thing that the enemy assails. Should it fall, we fall down
too. Therefore, either you guard its safety or leave it for us. and we will
certainty save you that task.” They got angry and threatened him, saying,
“Do you want us to deliver you our standard? Tomorrow when we will be
‘engaged in the battle, you will be witness to our deeds.” Such a reaction was
what Aba Sufyan had aimed at.

When the two parties drew closer to each other, Hind, the daughter of
“Utbah leading the Qurashi women tapped on tambourines bebind the
warriors to incite them,

On the Day of Ubud, the Prophet's Companions used “Kill, kill!” as a
slogan to call one another therewith. The people were engaged in fighting
until the battle grew fierce. Abd Dujinah fought until hel44M"t moved
forward through the enemy's rows. He killed whoever stood in his way of
the enemy. There was a man among the polytheists was busy with finishing
off the wounded Muslims, During the fight Ab Dujinah drew closer to that
man; so they were engaged in combat, exchanging two sword-strokes. The
polytheist struck AbG Dujanah, who warded off the blow with his shield.
Abd Dujanah struck him and killed him. His sword hovered over the head of
Hind, the daughter of “Utbah, but be spared it from her.""

‘When the Prophet (pbuh) was on his way back. Usayd ibn Hudayr met
hhim and greeted him saying, "O Prophet of Allah, you are moving off at a
bad time: you have never done that before." The Prophet (pbuh) said, “Have
you not heard of what your companion said?” He said, "Which companion?”
‘The Prophet (pbuh) said, " Abdullah ibn Ubayy." He said, "What did he say?"
‘The Prophet (pbuh) said, "He said that if he returned to Madinah, indeed the

‘Sa’d ibn Zayd over them and told them to head for the band until he himself
would follow them with the troops.

{n the engagement, Ab Qatidah al-Harith ibn Rib'i killed Habib ibn
“Uyaynah ibn Hisn and covered him with his mantle; then he joined his
force. The Prophet (pbuh) proceeded with Muslim warriors. As they saw
Habib covered with Abd Qutddah’s mantle, they exclaimed, “To, Allah we
belong and to Him is our return! Abd Qatidah has been slain.” The Prophet
(pbuh) said that it was not Abd Qutédah but a man killed by him and
covered with his mantle in order to know that he was his prey.

“Ukiishah reached Awbar and his son “Amir who were mounting on one
camel. and killed the two of them with one stroke of his lance. Some of the
mileh-camels Were recovered. The Prophet (pbuh) advanced until he
stopped and alighted at the mountain of Dh@ Qarad, where the men joined
him, and spent there a day and a night, Salamah ibnul-Akwa’ asked for
permission to go with a hundred men to recover the rest of the camels and
behead the-band. The Prophet (pbuh) said, "Now they should be having. their
evening milk-drink among the Ghatafan.” After the Prophet (pbuh) had divided
the butchered camels, one for every hundred men, he returned to Madinah.
‘The wife of Al-Ghifiri came riding on one of the Prophet's she-camels. She
told him the whole story, Then she said, "O Messenger of Allah, I made a

‘When the Muslims recognized the Prophet (pbuh) they took him and
ascended to a mountain pass, He was in the company of Abi Bakr. “Umar,
“ALi, ‘Talhah ibn “Ubaydillah, Az-Zubayr ibnulAwwam, Al-Harith
ibnus-Simmah, and others.

Reaching the glen, the Prophet (pbuh) was pursued by Ubayy ibn Khala
who said, "O Muhammad! Either you or I be will killed.” The people said,
"Shall any of us kill him?" The Prophet (pbuh) said, “Leave him alone."
Coming closer to him, the Prophet (pbuh) took a lance from Al-Harith
ibnus-Simmah, As I was told, He shivered violently in such a way that all of
them scattered in all directions at once. Facing him, the Prophet (pbuh)
stabbed him in the neck so that he swayed and rolled off his mate over and
over.

Previously in Makkah, Ubayy ibn Khalaf used to say to the Prophet
(pbuh), “O Muhammad, I have got a mare called Al-Awdh which I forage
every day with many quantities of com. T shall kill you, while riding it.”
“Bur J will Kill you if Allah wills,” was the Prophet's answer. When he teturned
to the Quraysh, he only had a small scratch on his neck. So when the blood
became congested he said, "By Allah, Muhammad has killed me." They
answered, “By Allah, you are afraid of death. By Allah, you are not hurt.”
He replied, "He told me when we were in Makkah that he would kill me.
and by Allah, had he spat on me, he would have killed me.” Eventually, the
‘enemy of Allah died at « place called Sarif, while they were taking him back
to Makkah,

When the Prophet (pbuh) arrived at the opening of the mountain pass,
“Alt went to fill his leather shield with water from the watering place of
Al-Mibiris and brought it to the Prophet (pbuh) (o drink, but he refused
because of its repulsive odor. Nonetheless, he used the water to wash the
blood fom his face. Pouring it over his head he said, "Allah's Wrath is great
‘on he who has bloodied the face of His Prophet."

‘The Prophet (pbuh) tried to mount a large rock on the mountain which
blocked his way. Being older and weaker besides wearing 1Wo armors, he
could not climb it, Talhah ibn “Ubaydillah squatted beneath him and
enabled the Prophet (pbuh) to stand on his back until he stood on it. After
Talhih's act, the Prophet (pbuh) said, “Talhah is eligible (for Paradise).”

‘Three polytheists were slain: Munabbih iba “Uthmin ibn “Ubayd who
Was injured by an arrow and died in Makkah because of it. There was also
from Ban Makhziim ibn Yagazah: Nawfal ibn ~Abdillah ibnul-Mughirah,
who penetrated the trench and was entrapped in it and killed, so the
Muslims too hold of his body. His people asked the Prophet (pbuh) to sell
them his body but he (pbuh) said, "We have no use for his boty nor the price
(ichich could be paid) for it", and he let them have it, And from Band “Amir
ibn Luayy, “Amr ibn “Abd Wudd was killed by “Alf ibn AbI Talib,

On the Day of Bana Qurayzah, Khallad ibn Suwayd from the Muslims,
Was martyred, when a millstone was thrown on him causing shattering
wound. It was said that the Prophet (pbuh) satd that he would be given the
reward of two martyrs. Abd Sindn ibn Mihsan ibn Hurthiin died during the
siege of Band Qurayzah and was buried in the burial ground of Band
Qurayzah. As I was told, after finishing the trench affair, the Prophet (pbuh)
Said, “The Quraysh will not invade you after this year, but you will invade them.”
‘The Quraysh did not invade them afterward, but he (pbuh) invaded them
until Allah the Almighty permitted that he conquered Makkah.

The Attack on Banfi Lihyan

After raiding Band Qurayzah the Prophet (pbuh) spent six months in
Madinah from Dhul-Hijjah to Jumida al-Old, He went out against Band
Lihyn to take revenge for Khubayb ibn *Adiyy and his companions who
were killed at Ar-Raji’. He pretended that hie was heading for Syria to attack
the people by surprise. He left Madinah’? und set forth passing by Ghurab, a
‘mountain near Madinah at the road to Syria, then to Makhid, to Al-Batra’,
and then he tured leftward to reach the valley of Bin, then to
‘Sukhayratul-Yammém, then straightforward on the highroad to Makkah. He
hastened the pace until he arrived at Ghurdn, the location of Band Libyan.

“O Bandi Kindnah, is this the leader of the Quraysh doing this to his cousin

him saying, “Allah is more Sublime and Exalted, We are not equal. Our
dead are in Paradise, while yours are in the Hell-Fite." At this Aba Sufyan
summoned “Umar to go to him. The Prophet (pbuh) told him to go and see
what he was up to. When he came Abd Sufyin said, “I beseech you by
Allah, O “Umar, have we killed Muhammad?” “By Allah, you have not, he
is listening to your talk now,” hie answered. He said, "I know you are more
truthful and reliable than Ibn Qami‘ah who said that he had killed
Muhammad.”

‘Then Abd Sufyin exclaimed, "Among your dead some are mutilated. By
Allah, Iam neither satisfied, nor angry, and 1 neither forbade nor
commanded mutilation.” While departing with his companions, Aba Sufyan
called out, "Your mecting-place is Badr nexi year.” "Yes, it is an
appointment for both of us," answered one of the Prophet's Companions
according to the commind of the Prophet (pbuh).

‘So the Prophet (pbuh) forgave them and forbade mutilation. Then be
(pbuh) ordered that Hamzah be covered in a mantle; then he performed the
funeral prayer over him. saying, “Allah is Greater” seven times. Then he
commanded that all the dead be brought beside Hamzah, and he offered
Prayer over them, Prayers which he had performed over them reached
seventy-two prayers.

bn Ishiiq said, “Safiyyah, the daughter of *Abdul-Muttalib came to see
Hamzah, who was her full-brother. The Prophet (pbuh) ordered her son,
Az-Zubayr ibmul-" Awwim, "Meet her and hold her back so that she will not see
what has happened to her brother.” He said to her, "O Mother, the Messenger
of Allah orders you to return.” She said, "Why? I have been informed that
they have mutilated him. But so long as itis for the sake of Allah, whatever
happens to him satisfies us. I will be calm and patient if Allah wills.” Back
to the Prophet (pbuh), Az-Zubayr reported to him what she had said. He
told him to leave her alone, She looked at Hamzah and said, "To Allah we
belong and to Him do we return”, and then she invoked Allah's forgiveness
for him. Then the Prophet (pbuh) ordered his burial.

Some Muslims carried their dead to Madinah to bury them there,
However, the Prophet (pbuh) prohibited this act saying that they should be
buried in the place where they had died, According to “Abdullah ibn
‘Tha'labah, while inspecting the martyrs of Uhud, the Prophet (pbuih) said,
“Lam a witness over these. Whoever is wounded for the sake of Allah will be re-
vived on the Day of Resurrection with his wounds bleeding with the color of blood
and the smell of musk. Find out the one who collected (or kept by heart) the
‘Qur'an more (or better) shan his companions and make him ahead of them in the

‘On his way to Madinah, the Prophet (pbuh) met Hamnah, the daughter

Prophet (pbuh), offered prayers with him towards the two giblas
Jerusalem and then Makkah) and swore the fealty of women to him, asked
the Prophet to give her Riff ah iba Samaw’al al-Qurayzt who was an adult
and who had resorted to her, as he knew them befote that. She said that he
had professed that he would offer prayers and eat camel's meat. The Prophet
(pbuh) accepted and she saved his life. Afterwards, the Prophet (pbuh) divided
the property, women, and children of Band Qurayzah among the Muslims.

‘Then the Prophet (pbuh) sent Sa‘d ibn Zayd al-Ansdri the brother of
*Abdul-Ashhal to Najd to sell some of the captive women of Band
Qurayzah for horses and arms. The Prophet (pbuh) had selected from their
women for himself Rayhinah the daughter of “Amr ibn Khunafah, who
remained under his power until he died. When the Prophet (pbuh) had
proposed to marry her and put the veil on her, she said, “O Messenger of
Allah, let me in your power, for that will be easier for me and you.” Hence
he left her. She had refused to convert to Islam when she was seized and
adhered to Judaism. Being displeased with her affair, the Prophet (pbuh)
secluded her. One day while he was with his Companions, he heard the
sound of footsteps behind hitn, so he ssid, "This is Tha'labah ibn Sa" yah
coming to tell me the good news of Rayhinah’s conversion to Islam." He
proclaimed the fact, which pleased the Prophet (pbuh).

Allah the Almighty revealed Quranic verses, concerning the Battle of
the Trench and Band Qurayzah. These verses are in Strat al-Abcib in which
He mentions the affliction that the Mustims suffered from, His grace to
them, and His help when He relieved them after the evil words said by the
hypocrites, Allah the Almighty says,

£0 you who believe! Remember Allah's Favour to you, when there came
against you hosts, and We sent against them a wind and forces that you
saw not lie, troops of angels during the battle of Al-Ahzdb (the Con-

Jederates)], And Allah is Ever All-Seer of what you do. >

Pursuit. Likewise, their enemy would know that the Muslims were mighty
and that their losses had not weakened them.

Leaving Ibn Umm Maktim in charge of Madinah, the Prophet (pbuh)
reached a place called Hamriul-Asad. about eight miles from Madinah, He
spent Monday, Tuesday. and Wednesday there and then returned to
Madinah. Ma°bad ibn Abi Ma’bad al-Khuziti met him. Both the Muslims
and polytheists of the Khuzi'ah were confidants of the Prophet (pbuh) in
Tihimah, as they agreed among themselves that they would never hide
anything from him of what was happening there. Though a polytheist,
Ma’bad said, “O Muhammad, by Allah, we are really sorry for what has
happened to you and! wish that Allah would keep you safe among them."

‘The Prophet (pbuh) met Ab Sufyan with his army at ArRawha’
‘They had determined to return to the Prophet and his Companions. They
thought that while they had killed the best of the Muslims, leaders, and
nobles. they wanted to attack their survivors to exterminate them. When
Ab@ Sufyan saw Ma’bad, he said, “What is up?” He answered, “Muhammad
‘has headed off with bis Compunions to follow you with an army which 1
have never seen the like. flaming with fury against you. Those who
previously stayed back are now joining him; they deplore their
non-artendance and are violently infuriated against you. Never have 1 seen
anything like it." He cried wonderingly, “Confound you, what are you
saying?” He answered, "By Allah, I do aot think that you should depart
before examining the forelocks of the cavalry.” “Bul we have decided to
jack them and uproot their survivors.” Abd Sufyan confirmed. Ma’ bad
added, "But | forbid that you do it.” Eventually, Mabad could change the
mind of Abd Sufyan and his followers.

A caravan of * Abdul-Qays met him. Krowing that they were heading for
Madinth for provisions, he said, “Would you give a message to Muharnmad
for me and 1 will load your caravan with raisins in the next forum of “Ukiz,
when you arrive there?” They accepted. He said, "When see him, tell him
that we are determined 10 march out to him and his Companions to
annihilate them." When the riders conveyed AbO Sufyan’s message to the
Prophet (pbuh) while he was in Hamra‘ul-Asad, he exclaitned, "Allah (Alone)

In the morning Bani Qurayzah succumbed to the Prophet's judgement
and the Aws were aroused saying, "O Messenger of Allah, they are our
allies, not the Khazraj's. You knowe-how you have recently treated theirs.
Previously the Prophet (pbuh) had besieged Band Qaynuga’, the ex-allies af
the Khazraj. As they had submitted to his judgement, “Abdullah ibn Ubayy
ibn Sal! asked to have them and the Prophet (pbuh) agreed. However,
when the Aws said those words to the Prophet (pbuh), he said, “Would vou be
sutisfied, O Aws, if one of your awn tribe gives the judgement concerning then?”
They agreed. so he suggested Sa°d ibn Mu’adh to be that man.

“The Prophet (pbuh) had made Sa’d ibn Mu’adh stay in a tent owned by a
‘woman from the Aslam called Rufaydah inside his mosque. She used to
‘nurse and take care of the wounded Muslims. When Sa°d had been injured
bby an arrow at the Battle of the Trench, the Prophet (pbuh) ordered that he
be put in Rufayda's tent until he would visit him later. When the Prophet
(pbuh) selected him to arbitrate on the issue of Bani Qurayzah, his people
went to him and put him on a donkey a leather cushion. as he was a
corpulent man. Bringing him to the Prophet (pbuh) they sid, "Be kind to
your friends, for the Messenger of Allah (pbuh) has appointed you to judge
for that very purpose.” When they kept on saying so, he said, "It is time for
Sa’d, in the cause of Allah, not to fear the blame of any blamer.” Hearing
his words, one of those who were in his company went to the household of
Bani" Abdul-Ashhal and preannounce to them the death of Band Qurayzah
before the arrival of Sa°d to them because of the words that be had just
heard from the latter.

When Sa'd reached the Prophet (pbuh) and the Muslims, the Prophet
{pbub) said, “Go to vour Chief”. The Mubijirtin of the Quraysh said that the
Prophet (pbuh) meant the Ansar, while the latter thought that he addressed
all the Muslims, so they got up and said, “O Abd ° Amr (meaning Sa’d), the
Prophet (pbuh) has put you in charge of your allies’ affair that you may
arbitrate concerning them." Sa'd asked, "Do you make a covenant with
Allah that you pass the judgement that [will pronounce on them?” They
said, "Yes". He added, “And the one who is here?” (Turning) in the
direction of the Prophet (pbuh) without mentioning his nume out of
veneration. The Prophet (pbuh) replied, “Yes”. Sa'd said. “Then my
judgement is that their men should be killed, wealth divided, and women
and children taken as prisoners of war.”

Islam, so they needed some of his Companions to go with them to instruct
them in religion, teach them how to recite the Qur'an, and to teach them the
Islamic laws, The Prophet (pbuh) sent six of his Companions: Marthad ibn
Abi Marthad; Khalid ibnul-Bukayr, “Asim ibn Thabit; Khubayb ibn
“Adiyy: Zayd ibnud-Dathinah ibn Mu’wiyah; and “Abdullah ibn Tariq. He
made Marthad as the leader.

When they reached Ar-Raji', a watering place of the Hudhayl towards
Al-Hijdz at the upper part of Al-Had'ah (between *Asfin and Makkah), the
Muslims were betrayed so they called the Hudhay! to help them against
them. While they were off guard, they were suddenly attacked by men with
swords, so they started to fight them: but the men said that they were not
intending to kill them as they wanted to profit from delivering them to the
people of Makkah. They pledged that they would not kill them. As for
Marthad, Khalid, and “Asim, they said, "By Allah, we will never accept a
covenant nor a pact from a polytheist.”

‘Thereupon a fight took place and the three were killed. The Hudhay!
attempted to take *Asim's head to sell it to Sulafah, the daughter of Sa‘d ibn
Shubayd. who, when he killed her two sons at Uhud, vowed that if she
could get his head, she would drink wine from his skull. When the Hudhayl
approached his body, some hornets came between it and them, so they
decided to leave him until nightfall when the homets would go away and
they would be able to take his head. Yet, Allah sent a flood in the valley to
carry “Asim's corpse away. “Asim had given Allah a pledge never to touch
nor be touched by a polytheist out of fear of impurity. When he heard about
the homets that protected "Asim, "Umar ibnul-Khatta said, "Allah protects
His believing servant, “Asim had vowed that no Polytheist should touch him
nor he would ever touch a polytheist in his life-span, so Allah protected him
after his death just as he had protected himself (i. from being touched by a
polytheist) while he was alive.”

Khubayb ibn “Adiyy, Zayd ibmul-Dathinah, and “Abdullah ibn Tariq
softened and yielded to their desire to live so they gave up and were fettered

to Makkah to be sold there. In Az-Zahrin, “Abdullah managed to unbind
himself from the rope with which he had been fettered and took hold of his

Approaching their forts, the Prophet (pbuh) said, "O you brothers of mon-
keys, has Allah disgraced you and sent His indignation on you?” They answered,
"O Abul-Qisim, you were never a barbarous person.”

‘When the Prophet (pbuh) reached Band Qurayzah be stopped by one of their
‘wells, adjacent to their possessions, called the Anna Well. His Companions
followed him, and among them were men whose last prayer was of the
‘Usha’, and they had not offered the “Agr prayer in accordance to the
Prophet's command not to do so except in Band Qurayzah. They had been
much preoccupied with war arrangements, unwilling to offer the prayer
until they would be in Band Qurayzah, complying with his order. Thus they
offered the “Asr prayer there after the “Isha’ prayer. Yet they were not disgraced
because of this by Allah, in His Book, nor did the Prophet (pbuh) reproach them.

Band Qurayzah were put under siege by the Prophet (pbuh) for twenty-five
nights until they were fatigued and Allah cast terror into their hearts.

Huyayy ibn Akhab had stayed with Band Qurayzah in their fors after
the withdrawal of the Quraysh and the Ghatafin, to preserve his word to
Ka’b ibm Asad. It became evident for them that the Prophet (pbuh) was
persistent to fight them, so Ka’b ibn Asad cried out, “O Jews, you can sce

‘become apparent to you that he is a Prophet with a Message and that it is he

women, and children.” They answered, "We will nevet violate the rules of

take this proposal, kill your wives and children and then go oiut, men only

die, we die, without leaving children behind us to worry about. If we win, we

creatures? How can we live after them?" He said, “Then if you do not take
this proposal “Tonight is the eve of Saturday. Most probably Muhammad and
his Companions will feel safe, so why do we not come down and seize
Muhammad and his Companions by surprise.” They suid, "Are we to
corrupt our Saturday and do on it what our predecessors had done as it is

said, "O Allah, we have delivered the Message of Your Messenger, so tell

they killed him, may Allah have mercy on him.

Mu'awiyah ibn Abi Sufyiin said, "I was there that day with those who
were with Abd Sufyfin, as he pushed me to the ground out of fear of
Khubuyb’s invocation.” They used to believe that if one was cursed, and
then slept on the side the curse would vanish. It was narrated that when
“Umar tbnul-Khattab appointed Sa’id ibn “Amir ibn Hidhyam al-Jumabi

‘want yout to fight. In case they have the opportunity they will make the best
of it; but in case they do not, they will flee to their own country and leave us
to encounter this man here. So convey our message to the Quraysh and the
‘Ghajafan, ‘By Allah, we will not fight Muhammad with them unless you
give us hostages.” They refused to do so. Allah stirred up distrust among
them. He sent a bitter storm against them on the extremely cold winter
nights, which overtumed their cooking-pots and vessels. Having learned
about their disagreement and how Allah had dispersed their confederation,
the Prophet (pbuh) summoned “Hudhayfah ibnul-Yamdn to send him to
them and find out what they had done that night.

Muhammad ibn Ks'b al-Quragi reported that a man from Kafah said to
Hudhayfah, "Did you really see the Messenger of Allah and accompany
him?” When he answered yes, he asked what they were doing. "We used to
live a hard fife.” Hudhayfah said. He said, "By Allah, if we were with him,
we would not have left him to walk on the ground, but would have carried
him on our shoulders.” Hudhayfah said, "O nephew, by Allah. we were with
the Prophet (pbuh) at the trench. After he had offered prayers for a part of
the night, he turned to us and asked, Who will get up and go to find ou for us

In the Battles of the Trench and Band Qurayzah, the Muslims’ ery was

Allah described the Prophet (pbuh) and his Companions being in fear
and difficulty when they were attacked by their enemy from above and
below. Nu’aym ibn Mas'did went to the Prophet (pbuh) telling him that he

him to command him to do anything he (pbuh) wanted. The Prophet (pbuh)
said, "You are only one man among us, so go and incite distrust among the enemy

Immediately, Nu°aym headed for Band Qurayzah with whom be had
been a comrade in his pre-Islamic days. After mentioning his good will
towards them and of their special relationship, they acknowledged that they
did not feel suspicious towards him. He said, “The Quraysh and the

Abdulli ibn Abi Bakr reported that they were driven out accompanied

girls, Among them was Umm “Amr or Salma, an ex-slave woman of
“Urwah ibnul-Ward al-Absi, whom they had. bought from him. Their
banishment was full of pompousness and splendor as had never been shown
by any tribe of their time,

Wealth still remained tor the Prophet (pbub) as booty, which he could as

Strat Al-Hashr was revealed entirely about Bani An-Nadir. It is a

kept on coaxing Ka’b until at last he gave up and promised him that if the
Quraysh and the Ghatafin failed to achieve their target, he would enter his
fortress to face the same fate as his. Thus he acquitted the covenant between
hhim and the Prophet (pbuh).

When news about the Jews’ intrigues to break their covenants reached
the Prophet (pbuh), he dispatched Sa’d ibn Mu’adh ibn an-Nu’min, the
leader of the Aws, and Sa‘d ibn “Ubddah ibn Dulaym, the leader of the
Khazraj. and Khawwat ibn Jubayr to find out whether the report was true or
not. "If it is true give me a eryptic message which | can understand, and do not
weaken the people's confidence: and if they still conform to their agreement with
us, declare it publicly before the people,” otdered the Prophet (pbuh).

them. He sent a bitter storm against them on the extremely cold winter
nights, which overtumed their cooking-pots and vessels. Having. leamed
about their disagreement and how Allah had dispersed their confederation,
the Prophet (pbuh) summoned “Hudhayfah ibnul-Yaman to send him to
them and find out what they had done that night,

‘Muhammad ibn Ka'b al-Quragi reported that a man from Kafah said (0
Hudhayfah, “Did you really see the Messenger of Allah and accompany
him?" When he answered yes, he asked what they were doing, "We used to
live a hard life." Hudhayfah said. He said, "By Allah, if we were with him.
‘we would not have left him to walk on the ground, but would have carried
him on our shoulders." Hudhayfah said, “O nephew, by Allah, we were with
the Prophet (pbuh) at the trench. After he had offered prayers for a part of
the night, he tumed to us and asked, Who will get up und go to fad out for us
what the enemy is doing and then return, and I will invoke Allah the Almighty that

“O Abul-Qasim, you were never a barbarous person.”

‘When the Prophet (pbuh) reached Band Qurayzah he stopped by one of their
‘wells, adjacent to their possessions, called the Ann Well. His Companions
followed him, and among them were men wliose last prayer was of the
sha’, and they had not offered the “Ase prayer in accordance to the
Prophet's command not to do so except in Band Qurayzah. They had been
much preoccupied with war arrangements, unwilling to offer the prayer
‘until they would be in Band Qurayzah, complying with his order. Thus they
offered the “Agr prayer there after the “Isha! prayer. Yet they were not disgraced
because of this by Allah, in His Book, nor did the Prophet (pbuh) reproach them,
Banfi Qurayzah were put under siege by the Prophet (pbuh) for twenty-five
nights until they were fatigued and Allah cast terror into their heart.

Huyayy ibn Akblab had stayed with Band Qurayzah in their forts after
the withdrawal of the Quraysh and the Ghatafin, to preserve his word to
Ka’b ibn Asad. It became evident for them that the Prophet (pbuh) was
persistent to fight them, so Kab ibn Asad cried out, "O Jews, you can see
‘what has befallen you: I propose to you three alternatives. Take which you
like the best: to follow this man and believe in him, for by Allah, it has
become apparent to you that he is a Prophet with a Message and that it is he
‘who is mentioned in your Book; and then you will secure your lives, wealth,
women, and children.” They answered, "We will never violate the nules of
the Torah and never replace it with another." He said, “Then if you do not
lake this proposal, kill your wives and children and then go out, men only
with their swords to fight Muhammad and his Companions leaving no
burdens behind you, until Allah judges between us and Muhammad. If we
die, we die, without leaving children behind us to worry about. If we win, we
can marry other wives and have children.” They said, “To kill these poor
creatures? How can we live after them?" He said, "Then if you do not take
this proposal "Tonight is the eve of Saturday. Most probably Muhammad and.
his Companions will feel safe, so why do we not come down and seize
Muhammad and his Companions by surprise.” They said, "Are we to
corrupt our Saturday and do on it what our predecessors had done as it is
well-known to you that they were turned into apes?” He answered, "None of

Islam, so they needed some of his Companions to go with them to instruct
them in religion, teach them how to recite the Qur'an, and to teach them the
Islamic laws. The Prophet (pbuh) sent six of his Companions: Marthad ibn
‘Abi Marthad; Khalid —ibnul-Bukayr; it : Khubayb ibn
“Adiyy; Zayd ibnud-Dathinah ibn Mu’awiyah; and “Abdullah ibn Tiirig. He
made Marthad as the leader,

When they reached Ar-Rajf’, a watering place of the Hudhayl towards
‘AL-Hijaz at the upper part of Al-Hlad'ah (between *Asfin and Makkah), the
Muslims were betrayed so they called the Hudhayl to help them against
them. While they were off guard, they were suddenly attacked by men with
‘swords, so they started to fight them; but the men said that they were not
intending to kill them as they wanted to profit from delivering them to the
people of Makkah. They pledged that they would not kill them. As for
Marthad, Khalid, «ind “Asim, they said, "By Allah, we will never accept a
‘covenant nor a pact from a polytheist.

‘Thereupon a fight took place and the three were killed. The Hudhayl
attempted to take * Agi head to sell it to Sulafah, the daughter of Sa°d ibn.
Shuhayd, who, when he killed her two sons at Uhud, vowed that if she
could get his head, she would drink wine from his skull. When the Hudhayl
approached his body, some homets came between it and them, so they
decided to leave him until nightfall when the hornets would go away and
they would be able to take his head. Yet, Allab sent a flood in the valley to
carry “Asim's corpse away. “Axim had given Allah a pledge never to touch
nor be touched by a polytheist out of fear of impurity. When he heard about
the hornets that protected “Asim, “Umar ibnul-KhattAb said, “Allah protects
His believing servant. “Asim had vowed that no polytheist should touch him
nor he would ever touch a polytheist in his life-span, so Allah protected him
after his death just as he had protected himself (i.e. from being touched by a
polytheist) while he was alive.”

Khubayb ibn “Adiyy, Zayd ibnul-Dathinah, and “Abdullah ibn ‘Tariq
softened and yielded to their desire to live so they gave up and were fettered
to Makkah to be sold there. In Az-Zahrin, “Abdullah managed to unbind
himself from the rope with which he had been fettered and took hold of his

In the morning Bani Qurayzah succumbed 10 the Prophet's judgement
and the Aws were aroused saying. "O Messenger of Allah, they are our
allies, not the Khazraj's. You knowshow you have recently treated theirs,”
Previously the Prophet (pbuh) had besieged Bandi Qaynuqa’. the ex-allies of
the Khazraj, As they had submitted to his judgement, “Abdullah ibn Ubayy
ibn Sal asked to have them and the Prophet (pbuh) agreed. However,
when the Aws said those words to the Prophet (pbuh), he said, "Would vou he
satisfied, O Aws, if one of your own tribe gives the judgement concerning them?”
‘They agreed, so he suggested Sa°d ibn Mu'fdh to be that man.

“The Prophet (pbuh) had made Sa°d ibn Mu'dh stay in a tent owned by a
woman from the Aslan called Rufaydah inside his mosque. She used to
nurse and take care of the wounded Muslims. When Sa°d had been injured
by an arrow at the Battle of the Trench, the Prophet (pbuh) ordered that he
be put in Rufayda’s tent until he would visit him later. When the Prophet
(phun) selected him to arbitrate on the issue of Band Qurayzah, his people
went to him and put him on a donkey a leather cushion, as he was a
corpulent man, Bringing him to the Prophet (pbuh) they suid, "Be kind to
your friends, for the Messenger of Allah (pbuh) has appointed you to judge
for that very purpose.” When they kept on saying so, he said, "It is time for
Sad. in the cause of Allah, not to fear the blame of any blamer." Hearing.
his words, one of those who were in his company went to the household of
Band "Abdul-Ashhal and preannounce to them the death of Band Qurayzah
before the arrival of Sa'd to them because of the words that he had just
heard from the latter.

When Sa‘d reached the Prophet (pbuh) and the Muslims, the Prophet
(pbuh) said, "Go w your Chies”. The Muhijiriin of the Quraysh said that the
Prophet (pbuh) meant the Ansar, while the latter thought that he addressed
all the Muslims, so they got up and said, "O Abd “Amr (meaning Sa°d), the
Prophet (pbuh) has put you in charge of your allies’ affair that you may
arbitrate concerning them." Sa’d asked, "Do you make a covenant with
Allah that you pass the judgement that 1 will pronounce on them?” They
said, "Yes". He added. “And the one who is here?” (Turing) in the
direction of the Prophet (pbuh) without mentioning his name out of
veneration. The Prophet (pbuh) replied, “Yes”. Sa'd said, “Then my
judgement is that their men should be killed, wealth divided, and women
and children taken as prisoners of war."

Pursuit. Likewise, their enemy would know that the Muslims were mighty
‘and that their losses had not weakened them.

Leaving Ibn Umm Maktim in charge of Madinah, the Prophet (pbuh)
reached a place called Hamri‘ul-Asad, about eight miles from Madinah, He
spent Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday there and then retumed to
Madinah, Ma'bad ibn Abj Ma’bad al-Khuza'i met him. Both the Muslims
and polytheists of the Khuzi'ah were confidants of the Prophet (pbuh) in
Tihamab, as they agreed among themselves that they would never hide
anything from him of what was huppening there: Though a polytheis.
Me'bad said, “O Muhammad, by Allah, we are really sorry for what has
happened to you and wish that Allah would keep you safe among them."

The Prophet (pbuh) met AbG Sufyin with his army at Ar-Rawha
They had determined to return to the Prophet and his Companions. They
thought that while they had killed the best of the Muslims, leaders, and
nobles, they wanted to attack their survivors to exterminate them. When
Aba Sufydin saw Ma’bad, he said, "What is up?” He answered, "Muhammad
has headed off with his Companions to follow you with an army which 1
have never seen the like, flaming with fury against you. Those who
Previously stayed back are now joining him; they deplore their
non-attendance and are violently infuriated against you. Never uve 1 seen
anything like it.” He cried wonderingly, “Confound you, what are you
saying?” He answered, "By Allah, 1 do not think that you should depart
before examining the forelocks of the cavalry.” "But we have decided to
attack them and uproot their survivors,” Abd Sufyin confirmed. Ma'bad
added, "But I forbid that you do it.” Eventually, Ma°bad could change the
mind of AbG Sufyan and his followers.

A caravan of “Abdul-Qays met him. Knowing that they were heading for
Madinah for provisions, he said, "Would you give a message to Muhammad
for me and I will load your caravan with raisins in the next forum of “Ukag,
when you arrive there?” They accepted. He said, "When see him, tell him
that we are determined to march out to him and his Companions to
annibilate them.” When the riders conveyed AbO Sufyén's message to the
Prophet (pbuh) while he was in Hamvd'ul-Asad, he exclaimed, "Allah (Alone)
ts Sufficient for us, and He is the Best Disposer of affairs (lor us)".

Prophet (pbuh), offered prayers with him towards the two giblaks
Gerusalem and then Makkah) and swore the fealty of women to him, asked
the Prophet to give her Rifi'ah ibn Samaw'al al-Qurayzi who was an adult
and who had resorted to her, as he knew them before that. She said that he
hhad professed that he would offer prayers and eat camel's meat. The Prophet
(pbuh) accepted and she saved his life, Afterwards, the Prophet (pbuh) divided
the property, women, and children of Band Qurayzah among the Muslims,

Then the Prophet (pbuh) sent Sa'd ibn Zayd al-Ansari the brother of
“Abdul-Ashhal to Najd to sell some of the captive women of Band
Qurayzah for horses and arms. The Prophet (pbuh) had selected from their
women for himself Raybinah the daughter of “Amr ibn Khundfah, who
remained under his power until he died. When the Prophet (pbuh) had
proposed to marry her and put the veil on her, she said, "O Messenger of
Allah, let me in your power, for that will be easier for me and you.” Hence
he left her, She had refused to convert to Islam when she was seized and
adhered to Judaism. Being displeased with her affair, the Prophet (pbuh)
secluded her. One day while he was with his Companions, he heard the
sound of footsteps behind him, so he said, "This is Tha'labah ibn Sa'yah
coming to tell me the good news of Raybinah’s conversion to Islam." He
proclaimed the fact, which pleased the Prophet (pbuh).

Allah the Almighty revealed Quranic verses, concerning the Battle of
the Trench and Band Qurayzah, These verses are in Siarat al-Ahzab in which
He mentions the affliction that the Muslims suffered from, His grace to
them, and His help when He relieved them after the evil words said by the
hypocrites, Allah the Almighty says,

£0 you who believe! Remember Allah's Favour to you, when there came
against you hosts, and We sent against them a wind and forces that you
saw not fie. troops of angels during the battle of AL-Ahadb (the Con-

{federates)]. And Allah is Ever Al-Seer of what you do. >

The hosts were the armies of the Quraysh, the Ghatafin, and Band
Qurayzah.

when the eves grew wild and the hearts reached to the throats, andl you
were harbouring doubis about Allah.

‘not but from Allah. And grieve not over them (polvtheists and pagans.
tc), and be not distressed because of what they plot.

(An-Nabl: 126-127)

So the Prophet (pbuh) forgave them and forbade mutilation, Then he
(pbuh) ordered that Hamzah be covered in a mantle; then he performed the
funeral prayer over him, saying, "Allah is Greater” seven times. Then he
commanded that all the dead be brought beside Hamzah, and he offered
Prayer over them, Prayers which he had performed over them reached
seventy-two prayers.

Ibn Ishfg said, "Safiyyah, the daughter of “Abdul-Muttalib came to see
‘Hamzab, who was her full-brother. The Prophet (pbuh) ordered her son,
Az-Zubayr ibnul-Awwim, "Meet her and hold her back so that she will not see
what has happened to her brother.” He said to her, "O Mother, the Messenger
of Allah orders you to return.” She said, “Why? I have been informed that
they have mutilated him. But so long as it is for the sake of Allah, whatever
happens to him satisfies us, | will be ealm and patient if Allah wills.” Back
to the Prophet (pbuh), Az-Zubayr reported to him what she had said. He
told him to leave her alone, She looked at Hamzah and said, “To Allah we
belong and to Him do we return”, and then she invoked Allah's forgiveness
for him, Then the Prophet (pbuh) ordered his burial.

Some Muslims carried their dead to Madinah to bury them there.
However, the Prophet (pbuh) prohibited this act saying that they should be
buried in the place where they had died. According to “Abdullah ibn
‘Tha'labah, while inspecting the martyrs of Uhud, the Prophet (pbuh) said,
"Lam a witness over these. Whoever ix wounded for the sake of Allah will be re-
vived on the Day of Resurrection with his wounds bleeding with the color of blood
and the smell of musk. Find out the one who collected (or kept by heart) the
Qur'an more (or better) than his companions and make him akead of them in the
grave.° Two or three bodies were buried in one grave.

‘On his way to Madinah, the Prophet (pbuh) met Hamnab, the daughter
of Jahsh. AS she met the army, they announced to her the death of ber
brother, “Abdullah ibn Jajsh. She said, "To Allah we belong and to Him do
wwe return, | ask Allah's forgiveness for him." Then she was told of the death

Hind, the daughter of “Utbah and. some women with het, halted 10
mutilate the Muslim corpses. After they cut off their ears and noses making
them into anklets, necklaces, and pendants, Hind gave them to Wabshi, the
slave of Jubayr iba Mufim. She even ripped open Hamzah’s liver and
chewed it, but she could not stand its taste and spat it out

Al-Hulays ibn Zabban, who was the leader of the black warriors, passed
by Abdi Sufydn while he was hitting the side of Hamzah's mouth with the
edge of his spear saying, "Taste that, you insurgent.” Al-Hulays exclaimed,
“O Band Kindnah. is this the leader of the Quraysh doing this to his cousin
while dead?” He said, "Confound you, keep it secret, for it was just a slip.”

Having decided to depart, Abd Sufyan climbed up the mountain yelling
a the top of his voice. “Good work! Victory in war goes by alternate
success; this day for the day (of Badr). Be sublime Hubal (an idol)” "ie.
uphold your religion”. The Prophet (pbuh) told “Umar to get up and answer
him saying, "Allah is more Sublime and Exalted, We are not equal. Our
dead are in Paradise, while yours are in the Hell-Fire.” At this Abd Sufyan
summoned “Umar to go to him. The Prophet (pbuh) told him to go and see
what he was up to, When he came Ab@ Sufyan said, “I beseech you by
Allah, O “Umar, have we killed Muhammad?” "By Allah, you have not, he
is listening to your talk nw." he answered, He said, "I know you are more
truthful and reliable than thn Qami’ah who said that he had killed
Muhammad.”

Then AbG Sufyin exclaimed, “Among your dead some are mutilated. By
Allah, (am neither sutisfied, nor angry, and 1 neither forbade nor
commanded mutilation.” While departing with his companions, Aba Sufyan
called out. “Your meeting-place is Budr next year.” "Yes, it is an
appointment for both of us,” answered one of the Prophet's Companions
asecording to the command of the Prophet (pbuh),

‘Then the Prophet (pbuh) commanded “Ali, "Go after them, to trace out
their movements and intention. If they are dismounting their horses and riding
their camels they will be heading for Makkah, whereas if they are riding their hors-

Whose Hand ix my soul, if they make for Madinah t will march out to them and

Three polytheists were slain: Munabbih ibn “Uthman ibn “Ubayd who
‘was injured by an arrow and died in Makkah because of it. There was also
from Bang Makhztim ibn Yaqazah: Nawfal ibn “Abdillaih ibnul-Mughirah,
who penetrated the trench and was entrapped in it and killed, so the
Muslims t00 hotd of his body. His people asked the Prophet (pbuh) to sell
them his body but he (pbuh) said, "We have no use for his body nor the price
(which could be paid) for it”, and he let them have it. And from Band “Amir
ibn Lu'ayy, “Amr ibn “Abd Wadd was killed by “Alf ibn Abt Talib.

On the Day of Band Qurayzah, Khalldd ibn Suwayd from the Mustims,
was martyred, when a millstone was thrown on him causing a shattering
wound. It was said that the Prophet (pbuh) said that he would be given the
reward of two martyrs, Abd Sinda ibn Mibsan ibn Hurthin died during the
iege of Band Qurayzah and was buried in the burial ground of Band
Qurayzah. As 1 was told, after finishing the trench affair, the Prophet (pbuh)
said, “The Quraysh will not invade you after this year, but you will invade them.”
‘The Quraysh did not invade them afterward, but he (pbuh) invaded them
uuntil Allah the Almighty permitted that be conquered Makkah.

The Attack on Band Lihyan

After raiding Band Qurayzah the Prophet (pbuh) spent six months in
Madinah from Dhul-Hijjah to Jumada al-Cla. He went out against Band
Lihydn to take revenge for Khubayb ibn “Adiyy and his companions who
were killed at Ar-Raji”. He pretended that he was heading for Syria to attack
the people by surprise. He left Madinah"? and set forth passing by Ghurab, a
mountain near Madinah at the road to Syria, then to Makhid, to Al-Batra’,
and then he turned leftward to reach the valley of Bin, then to
‘Sukhayrdtul-Yammam, then straightforward on the highroad to Makkah, He
hastened the pace until he arrived at Ghuran, the location of Band Libyan,

When the Muslims recognized the Prophet (pbuh) they took him and
‘uscended to a mountain pass. He was in the company of Aba Bakr, “Umar,
Ali, Talhah ibn Ubaydillah, Az-Zubayr ibnul>Awwim, Al-Harith
ibnus-Simmah, and others.

Reaching the glen, the Prophet (pbuh) was pursued by Ubayy ibn Khalaf
who said, “O Muhammad! Either you or I be will killed.” The people said,
"Shall any of us kill him?” The Prophet (pbuh) said, "Leave him alone.”
Coming closer to him, the Prophet (pbuh) took a lance from Al-Harith
ibnus-Simmah. As T was told, He shivered violently in such a way that all of
them scattered in all directions at once. Facing him, the Prophet (pbuh)
stabbed him in the neck so that he swayed and rolled off his mare over and
over.

Previously in Makkah, Ubayy iba Khalaf used to say to the Prophet
(pbuh), "O Muhammad, | have got a mare called Al- Awdh which | forage
every day with many quantities of corn, 1 shall kill you, while riding it.”
“But will kill you if Allah wills,” was the Prophet's answer, When he returned
to the Quraysh, be only had a small scratch on his neck. So when the blood
became congested he said, "By Allah, Muhammad has killed me.” They
answered, "By Allah, you are afraid of death, By Allah, you are not hurt.”
He replied, “He told me when we were in Makkah that he would kill me.
and by Allah, had he spat on me, be would have killed me.” Eventually, the
‘enemy of Allah died at a place called Sarif, while they were taking him back
to Makkah

When the Prophet (pbuh) arrived at the opening of the mountain pass,
“Ali went to fill his leather shield with water from the watering place of
Al-Mibris and brought it to the Prophet (pbuh) to drink, but he refused
because of its repulsive odor. Nonetheless, he used the water to wash the
blood from his face. Pouring it over his head he said, “Allah's Wrath is great
‘on hi who has bloodied the face of His Prophet,”

The Prophet (pbuh) tried to mount a large rock on the mountain which
blocked his way. Being older and weaker besides wearing two armors, he
could not climb it. Talbab ibn “Ubaydillah squatted benewth him and
enabled the Prophet (pbuh) to stand on his back until he stood on it. After
Talhah’s act, the Prophet (pbuh) said, "Lalhah is eligible (for Paradise).”

ibn Zayd. When they had come together to the Prophet (pbuh), he appointed
Sa'd ibn Zayd over them and told them to head for the band until he himself
would follow them with the troops,

In the engagement, Abd Qatidah al-Harith ibn Rib’i killed Habib ibn
“Uyaynah ibn Hisn and covered him with his mantle; then he joined his
force. The Prophet (pbuh) proceeded with Muslim warriors. As they saw
Habib covered with Abii Qatidah’s mantle, they exclaimed, "To Allah we
belong and to Him is our return! Abd Qatadah has been slain." The Prophet
(pbuh) said that it was not Abd Qutidah but a man killed by him and
covered with his mantle in order to know that he was his prey.

“Ukashah reached Awbir and his son “Amr who were mounting on one
camel, and killed the two of them with one stroke of his lance, Some of the
milch-camels were recovered. The Prophet (pbuh) advanced until he
stopped and alighted at the mountain of DhO Qurad, where the men joined
him. and spent there a day and a night, Salamah ibnul-Akwa’ asked for
permission to go with a hundred min to recover the rest of the camels and
behead the band. The Prophet (pbuh) said, "Now they should be having their
evening milk-dritk among the Ghatafén.” After the Prophet (pbuh) had divided
the butchered camels, one for every hundred men, he retumed to Madinah.
‘The wife of AL-Ghifiri came riding on one of the Prophet's she-camiels. She
told him the whole story. Then she said, “O Messenger of Allah, | made a
vow to Allah that I would slay this she-camel if He rescued me on it." The
Prophet (pbuh) smiled and said, "Whara had reward! Will you slaughter it after
Alla has mounted you on it andl delivered you by it! Verily, there is no vow in dis-
obedience t0 Allah nur concerning anything that is not yours. The she-camel is
‘mine, 30 go back t0 your family with Allah's blessing.”

prevented me and I knew that Allah would surely kill him.” he said.

“Asim ibn Thabit ibn Abel-Aglah killed Musifi° ibn Talhah and his
brother Al-Jullis by picreing both of them with a dart, Each came to his
mother, Sulifah, laying his head on her lap. She asked, "Who has injured
you, my son?" "[ heard a man while shooting me saying, Take it, fam Ibn

Hangalah ibn Abj “Amir, who was called ‘the Washed One’, and Abi
Sufyan’ met in battle. When Hanzalah had beaten Abd Sufyan, Shaddid
ibnul-Aswad, who was Ibn Shitdb, smote and killed him. The Prophet
(pbuh) said, "Your companion (ie. Hanzaluh) is being washed by the Angels, so
cask his wife if there was something (that happened) ro him.” When they inquired
hhis wife, she said that he rushed to the battlefield when he heard the eall for
war while being in a state of jandbah.” Then Allah sent down His help to
the Muslims and fulfilled His promise. They uprooted their enemy with
their swords until they dragged them away from their camp. Tt was an
obvious defeat.

Az-Zubuyr said, “I saw the anklets of Hind, the daughter of "Uthaly and
her friends because they were folding up their dresses as they ran: away.
Nothing prevented anyone from catching them when the archers turned to
the camp as the enemy had been thrown out of it. Thus we were attacked
from behind by the cavalry. Someone cried out, "Ha, Muhammad has been
killed.’ We retumed and the enemy pursued us after we had killed the
standard bearers, So that none of them would dare take it. The standard
remained on the ground until “Amrah Al-Harithiyyah, the daughter of

‘When the Prophet (pbuh) was on his way back, Usayd ibn Hudayr met

‘one and you are the honorable one!” He added, "O Messenger of Allah, be
‘kind to him, for Allah brought you to us while his People were about to
‘rown him, and he believes that you have deprived him of a kingdom.”

Then the Prophet (pbuh) having the men with him kept on walking all
through the day until the evening, then throughout the night until the
morning of the next day, so the sun harassed them. Then he stopped to
alight. Once they were on the ground they fell asleep. He (pbuh) was
deliberate in doing this, so as to divert their thoughts from the affair of
Abdul ibn Ubayy.

Then the Prophet (pbuh) proceeded to a watering place known as Bag*a’
in Al-Hijaz a little above Al-Naqi”. While on their journey during the night,
4 very strong wind blew which terrified them. The Prophet (pbuh) soothed
them, declaring that this wind designated the death of one of the greatest of
the disbelievers, Back in Madinah, they discovered that the one who had
died that day was Rifiah ibn Zayd ibnut-Tabat of Band Qaynugd’, a great
figure among the Jews and a secret haven for the hypocrites.

Allah the Most High revealed a Siirah about the hypocrites, Ibn Ubayy
and the like. Thereupon taking hold of Zayd ibn Arqam's ear, the Prophet
(pbuh) said, “This is the one who devoted his ear o Allah”. “Abdulla the son of

Abii Sufyan said to the standard bearers of Band “Abdud-Dar, spurring
them to war, "O Band ‘Abdud-Dir! You have béen assigned to bear our
standard on the Day of Badr and you know what has happened. The
standard iy the first thing that the enemy assails. Should it fall, we fall down
too. Therefore, either you guard its safety or leave it for us, and we will
certainly save you that task.” They got angry and threatened him, saying,
"Do you want us to deliver you our standard? Tomorrow when we will be
‘engaged in the battle, you will be witness to our deeds.” Such a reaction was
what Abdi Sufydin had aimed at,

On the Day of Uhud, the Prophet's Companions used "Kill, kill!” as a
slogan to call one another therewith. The people were engaged in fighting
until the battle grew fierce. AbO Dujinah fought until hel44M"t moved
forward through the enemy's rows, He killed whoever stood in his way of
the enemy. There was a man among the polytheists was busy with finishing
off the wounded Muslims. During the fight Abi Dujanah drew closer to that
man; so they were engaged in combat, exchanging two swond-strokes. The
polytheist struck AbO Dujanah, who warded off the blow with his shield.
Abd Dujiinah struck him and killed him. His sword hovered over the head of
Hind, the daughter of "Utbah, but he spared it from her."

From Yazid ibn Rimén, the Prophet (pbub) dispatched Al-Walid ibn

heard that he was coming, they went out to meet him, but when he knew
that they were coming, he became frightened so he returned to the Prophet
(pbuh) telling him that they were going to kill him and thus had detained
their alms. The Muslims were indulged in talk to invade them until the
Prophet (pbuh) himself was about to do so. In the middle of this, a
delegation of theirs went to the Prophet (pbuh) saying, "O Messenger of
Allah, we heard of your envoy whom you sent, so We went out to honor him
and t0 pay due alms, but he tumed back as rapidly as he could, Then we
were told that he alleged that we intended to slay him. By Allah, we did not
‘come out for that." So Allah sent down on this incident,

~Abilullih ibn Ubayy ibn Salt supported the Prophet's (pbub) opinion,
not to go out to fight them, The Prophet (pbuh) did not like to fight outside
Madinah, but some Mustims whom Allah honored with martyrdom at Ubud
and others who did not attend Badr said, "O Messenger of Alla, let is go
forth to our enemies, otherwise they will think that we are cowards and
weak to fight them." Ibn Salil said, "O Messenger of Allah, stay in
Madinab, and do not turn to them. It has never been that we went forth to
fight an enemy but we have been defeated, and none has come here against
us but have been vanquished. Thus leave them in their place. If they stay, it
will be the worst entanglement, while if they enter Madinah, men will fight
them, women and children will hurl them with stones from the walls, and if
they retreat, they will be feeling disappointed as they came,"

With the persistence of those who were eager to fight the Quraysh, the
Prophet (pbuh) went into his house and was armored. ‘That was on Friday
after prayer, On that day, Milik ibn “Amr of the Ansar from Band
An-Najjar died. After offering prayer over the dead Ansiri, the Prophet
(pbuh) headed for war. Meanwhile, the people blamed themselves for
pressing on the Prophet (pbuh) to fight against his will, which they had no
right to do, so when he came out to them they admitted that if he wished to
stay in Madinah they would not oppose him. The Prophet (pbuh) remarked,
“Inés not appropriate for a Prophet who has put on his armor to wake it off until he
‘has fought.” He set forth with a thousand of his Companions. until they
reached Ash-Shawt between Madinah and Uhud, where “Abdulla ibn
Ubayy seceded with a third of the warriors, saying, "He (the Prophet) has
obeyed them and disobeyed me. We do not know why we should kill
ourselves here, O men.”

So he withdrew with his followers who were hypocrites and doubters.
Abdullah ibn "Amr ibn Harim followed them saying, "O people. I beseech
you by Allah not to forsake your people and your Prophet while the enemy
is nearby.” They answered. “If there should be a fight we would not
relinguish but we do not think that there will be a war.” When they persisted
on withdrawal, he said, "May Allah deport you, you enemies of Allab, for
Allah will make His Prophet dispensable of you." On that day the Ansar
asked, "O Messenger of Allah, should we not seek the stipport of our Jewish
allies?” He said," We have no need of them."

out, including Aba Sufyan, carrying a large amount of silver which
constituted most of their trade. They appointed Furat ibn Hayyan from Band.

winter drops of water falling from his brow: he said, ‘Be of good cheer,

had invaded the Prophet (pbuh). Thereupon, he moved off with two hundred
‘Qutyshis to execute his pledge. He took the Najdiyyah route and halted at
an inlet of a canal to the Thayb mountain, miles from Maclinah. Nightly he
set forth to Band An-Nadir heading for Huyayy ibn Akhtab, Knocking on

The Invasion of Dha Amarr

separate them, so they lived together as Mustim and disbeliever, until the
Prophet (pbuh) emigrated. Abul- As joined the Quraysh on the Day of Badr
but he was seized among the captives and taken to Madinah with the
Prophet (pbuh). When the Quraysh sent to redeem their prisoners, Zaynab
sent money to ransom her husband and the money included a necklace
which her mother, Khadijah, had given her on her wedding. When the
Prophet (pbuh) saw the necklace his feelings became greatly tender and he
said (to his Companions), "If you would think that you set her captive husband
{free and repay her money, do so.” They uccepted and did so.

‘Thus, Abul-\Ay lived in Makkah, while Zaynab lived in Madinah with
the Messenger of Allah (pbuh), Abul- As went to Syria as a merchant
his wealth and that which the Quraysh had entrusted him with, as he was a
reliable man. On his way back, he was attacked by a Muslim raid which
took his merchandise, but he managed to run away. When the raiders went
away with their booty, Abul- Ag went to Zaynab’s house in the night,
seeking her protection as well as the return of his property.

While the Prophet (pbuh) with the Muslims was performing the morning
prayer, Zaynab cried out from among the women, "O people, I have given
protection to Abul-’Ag ibnur-Rab?’.” After the prayer, the Prophet (pbuh)
‘made sure that the people had heard Zaynab’s declaration and added, “By
Him in Whose hands is Muhammad's soul, 1 had known nothing (about the matter)
before hearing what you have heard. The Muslims can protect whoever is lower
than them.” He afterward headed for his daughter and said to her, “Make his
stay comfortable, but do not let him touch you. since you are not lawful for him.”

According (o “Abdullah ibn Abi Bakr, the Prophet (pbuh) sent to those
who raided Abul-As saying, "This man as you know is our relative, and you
have taken his property. If you do a charitable act and restore him his property, we
like you to; if not, itis a booty which Allah has bestowed on you. and you have the
better right to it." They expressed their will to return it. They were so keen to
restore everything and not to withhold anything. Abul-Ag went to Makkah
(o pay all the dues to the Quraysh, making sure that no one had any further
claim on him. "No," they said, "May Allah reward you; you have been both
honest and generous." "Therefore”, said he, "I bear witness that there is no

Prophet (pbuh) saying. “Here is the head of the enemy of Allah, AbG Jahl.”
He said, "By Allah other than Whom there is no god, is it?” “Yes,” Ibn Mas’ Od
said, throwing his head before the Messenger of Allah (pbuh). who then

When the Prophet (pbuh) commanded that the corpses should be all cast
into a pit, all were thrown with thie exception of that of Umayyah ibn Khalaf
which had swelled within his armor to the extent that it filled it. When they
tried to carry his corpse, it disintegrated, so they left it where it was and
heaped earth and stones on it.

After throwing the corpses into the pit, the Companions heard the
Prophet (pbuh) at midnight saying, "O people of the pit, “Utbuh in Rabiah,
Shaybah ibn Rabi'ah, Umayyah ibn Khalaf, Abi Juhl, = and be counted out those
in the pit. ~ have you found true what your Lord had promised vou, for I have
deed found true what my Lord had promised me?" His Companions said, "O
Messenger of Allah, are you talking to the dead?” He said, "They can hear me
‘nore than you but they cannon ansicer.”

Afterwards the Prophet (pbuh) ordered to bring together all the spoils of
‘war that had been collected in the camp. The Muslims disputed over thern,
The group which had collected them thought they were theirs: the warriors
who pursued the enemy claimed that they were the cause for getting them;
while the guards who escorted the Prophet (pbuh) to defend him from the
‘enemy. claimed that they had wanted (0 collect the spoils but they feared
that the enemy might return, so they kept their position with the Prophet
(pbuh).

‘Then the Prophet (pbuh) dispatched “Abdullah ibn Rawabah with the
news of victory to the people of Upper Madinah, and Zayd ibn Harithah to
the people of Lower Madinah. Then the Prophet (pbuh) began his journey
back to Madinah with the disbelieving captives, among whom were “Uqbah

they had done so, he said, "By Allah, this is the (saying) Forgive us' which was
‘ordained on the Children of Israel, but they did not say it.”

‘The Prophet (pbuh) gave orders to travel towards the right, through salty
‘growth, on the way leading to the spot of Thaniyyat al-Murar onto the slope
‘of Al-Hudaybiyah below Makkah.

‘When the cavalry of the Quraysh noticed the dust of the Muslims’ forces
and that they had averted them, they galloped back to their Quraysh. When
the Prophet (pbuh) reached Thaniyyat al-Murat, his she-camel knelt down.
The men believed that it would not get up. The Prophet (pbuh) commented,

“It has never been stubborn, as it is not its nature, but it has been with-
held by what restrained the elephant from Makkah. Today I shall accept
whatever plan through which the Quraysh ask me-to confirm kindred
ties.”

‘Then he told the people to descend. They hesitated at first, for there was
‘no water at which they could stop. Thus, the Prophet (pbuh) took an arrow
from his quiver and gave it to one of his Companions to prod in the middle
of a water hole. The water thereafter gushed out until the men and their
‘camels had drunk to their fll. They encamped there.

While the Prophet (pbuh) was staying there, Budayl ibn Wargi!
al-Khuzi'i came with some men of the Khuzi‘ah asking him about the
reason for his coming. He told them that it was not for war but to visit and
Venerate the Sanctuary. Then he repeated what he had said to Bishr ibn
‘Sufyan. When they conveyed his words to the Quraysh, they suspected them
and were rude to them, saying, "Even if he is not coming for war, by Allah,
he shall never enter it against our desire, nor shall the Arabs ever utter that
we have accepted it.”

‘The Khuzii'ah tribe, Muslims and polytheists, were confidants of the
Prophet, always keeping him informed of everything that was taking place
in Makkah. When the Prophet (pbuh) saw Mikras ibn Hafs ibnul-Akhyaf
who was sent by the Quraysh, he said, "This is a reacherous man!” When he
approached and spoke to him, he answered him with the same words as he
had said to Budayl and his companions. Mikras returned to the Quraysh

a dense surface which did not prevent the Prophet's movements, but
severely confined the movements of the Quraysh. ‘The Prophet (pbuh)
hhurried to the water. Getting to the proximal water of Badr, he settled down,

Al-Hubib ibnulMundhir said, “O Messenger of Allah, is this the spot
which Allah has inspired you to occupy. so that we cannot move from it, or
is it a matter of stratagem of war and the product of consultation?” When
the Prophet (pbuh) said that it was a stratagem of war and consultation,
Al-Hubab pointed out, "Its not a good place to stop in. Let us continue and
encamp by the nearest well of water and make a cistern full of water, and
destroy the other wells; then we can fight our enemy who will have nothing
to drink.

The Prophet (phuh) approved of his excellent plan which was
immediately carried out; the wells were destroyed: a cistern was constructed
and filled with water from which his men filled their drinking-vessels,

Sa'd ibn Mu"iidh said, "O Prophet of Allah, let us make a hut for you to
stay in, having your riding beasts await; then we will go on fighting the
‘enemy and if Allah grants us victory, that is what we wish; if itis defeat,
you could ride your camels and go back to Madinah to our people who are
left behind, for they love you as much as we do. If they knew that you
would go to war they would not have remained behind. Allah will protect
‘you with them; they will give you good advice and strive in the cause of
Allah with you.” The Prophet (pbuh) praised him and prayed to Allah for
his good. Then a trellis was built for the Prophet (pbuh) and he stayed there.

Having moved in the morning, the Prophet (pbuh) saw the Quraysh
from the ‘Agangal dune into the valley, he exclaimed,

here is the Quraysh coming. in their conceit and haughtiness
challenging You and belving Your Messenger. O Allah, grant me victory
which You have promised. O Allah, destroy them this morning!"

When the Quraysh settled down, a number of them. among whom was
Hakim ibn Hizdm, went to the Prophet's basin to drink. The Prophet (pbuh)
et them drink, but whoever drank of it on that day was slain with the
exception to Hakim who later became a devout Muslim and used to say,
when he was fervid in his oath, "By Him Who rescued me on the Day of Badr.”

know this. Write instead "In Your name, O Allah.” The Prophet (pbuh) agreed
to write that. Then he said, "Write down ‘This is what Muhammad, the Mes-
senger of Allah has reconciled with Suhayl ibn “Amr.” Subyal objected, “If 1
witnessed that you are Allah's Messenger, I would not fight you. Write your
‘own name and your father's." The Prophet (pbuh) said,

“Write This is what Muhammad ibn “Abdullah has reconciled with Su-
hhayl ibn “Amr. They have agreed to stop all fighting for ten years, during
which time the people will live safely, restraining from animosities on
condition that in case anyone goes to Muhammad without his guardian's
‘permission, he will send him back to them: and in case that anyone of
‘Muhammad's followers goes to the Quraysh they will not Seng him buck
10 him, We will aot show hostility one to another and there will be no
theft or treachery, He who wishes to enter into a covenant and agree-
‘ment with Muhammad may do $0 and he who wishes to enter into a cov-
‘enant and agreement with the Quraysh may do so."

‘The Khuza’ah chose to enter into a bond and agreement with the Prophet
(pbuh), while Band Bakr chose the Quraysh and said to the Prophet (pbuh),
"You should keep back from us this year, not enter Makkah against our will,
As for the next year, we will leave it for you to spend three nights with your
Companions. Thereupon, you may bring with you nothing more than riders’
‘weapons and swords in sheaths.”

While the Prophet (pbuh) and Suhayl were writing the agreement, Aba
Jandal ibn Suhayl ibn “Amr suddenly showed up in fetters, having fled to
the Prophet (pbuh). The Prophie’s Companions left and they did not doubt
the conquest of Makkah, for they depended on a vision (dream) which the
Prophet (pbuh) had seen, When they saw the talks for peace and withdrawal
taking place and what the Prophet (pbuh) had endured, they were extremely
depressed almost to the point of death. When Suhayl saw Abi Jandal, he
slapped him on the face and gripped his collar, saying, "O Muhammad, the
issue between us was resolved before this man arrived to you.” He agreed.
Suhay! pulled him violently by his collar and drew him away to send him
back to the Quraysh, while Ab Jandal yelled with all his strength, "O
Muslims! Am I to be sent back to the polytheists to seduce me from my
religion?” This augmented the people's grief. The Prophet (pbuh) said,

Then the Prophet (pbuh) halted near Badr, He rode on with one of his
‘Companions until he met an ok! Bedouin. He asked him about the Quraysh
«as well as about Mutiaonmad and his Companions, and whether he had any
information about them. The old man stated, "I will not tell you until you
tell me which of the two you are.” The Prophet (pbuh) retorted, “lf you a-
wer us, we will tell vou." He said, "Tit for tat?" "Yes", he replied. The
Bedouin said. "I have heard that Muhammad and his Companions moved on
such-and-such a day. If that is right, they today should have reached
such-and-such a place. (referring to where the Prophet (pbuh) actually was).
‘Also I heard that the Quraysh marched out on such-and-such a day. so today
they should have been in such-and such a place,” where they actually were.
When he had finished be said, "Where did you come from?" The Prophet
(pbuh) said, “We are from ma*®.* Then he departed, while the old man was
saying, "What does this mean? Is he from the Ma’ of Iraq?”

‘Then the Prophet (pbuh) went back to his Companions. In the evening,
he sent “Ali iba Abi Talib, Az-Zubayr ibnul-’ Awwam, and Sa°d ibn Abi
Wagaiis with a number of the Companions to the well at Badr in search of
news. where they seized some of the Quraysh water-men, among whom
were Astam of Band Al-Hajj, and “Arid Abd Yasir of Band AlAs ibn
‘Said. They caught them and inquired of them while the Prophet (pbub) was
performing prayer. They said, "We are the water-men of the Quraysh; they
sent us to bring them water.” The people did not like their answer, as they
hoped that they belonged to AbG Sufydin. Thus, they beat them severely
until the two claimed that they belonged to Abd Sufyn, So they released
them. When the Prophet (pbub) finished his prayers, he said, “When they told
‘You the truth you beat them: and when they lied you released them? They spoke the
truth for they belong t0 the Quraysh. Inform me (you two) what about the Qu-
raysh?” They retorted, "They are behind this dune which you see on the
remotest embankment.” The Prophet (pbuli) asked them about their number
and they said that they were many but they did not know their exact
number; hence he inguired of them about the number of beasts they
sacrificed each day. When they said nine or ten, he said, "The people are be-

‘Az-Zubri said that no previous victory was greater than this. It was only
fighting when people met; however, when there was an armistice instead of
war, people felt secure, sat together, and negotiated to settle disputes. Thus,
none rationalized what was said concerning Islam but embraced it, In those
two years as many embraced Islam as ever before, perhaps more.!")

The March to Khaybar in Al-Muharram, 7 AH

After his return from Al-Hudaybiyah, the Prophet (pbuh) spent
Dhul-Hijjah and part of Al-Mubarram in Madinah, while the polytheists
‘were in charge of pilgrimage, ‘Then in the remainder of Al-Moharram he set
forth against Khaybar, Abi Mu’attib iba “Amr related, "When the
Messenger of Allah oversaw Khaybar he said to his Companions, while 1
‘was among them, ‘Stop’, Then he said, (0 Allah, Lord of the heavens andl what
they overshadow, Lord of the lands and what they make to sprout, Lord of the dev
its and what they lead astray, Lord of the winds and whut they winnow! We ask
You the goodness ofthis town. the goodness ofits people, und the goodness of what
ivi it, We seek Your refuge from its evil the evi ofits people, and the evil of what
isin it, Proceed in the name of Allah’ That was what he used to say on entering
every town.”

Anas ibn Malik related, “The Messenger of Allah (pbuh) used to make
his raids in the morning. If he heard the call to prayer he would not advance,
and if he did not hear it he would raid, We reached Khaybar at night, and
the Prophet (pbuh) spent the night there, In the moming as he did not hear the
call to prayer, he rode and we rode with him, and I was riding behind Aba
Talhah with my foot touching the Prophet's. We met the laborersof Khaybar
in the morning with their spades and baskets. On seeing the Prophet (pbuh)
and the army they yelled, "Muhammad with his army,” and turned tail and
escaped. The Prophet (pbuh) said, “Ailéhu Ashar! Khaybar is destroyed. When
we alight in a people's yard, it is.a bad morning for hose who are warned.’

Ibn Ishiq said, “The Prophet (pbuh) stepped out from Madinah to
Khaybar throughout “Ise”, where a mosque was constructed for him; then

Kindinah will not assail you in the back,” so they dashed swifily.

A few nights had passed of the month of Ramadin, when the Prophet
(pbuh) went to war. He charged “Amnr ibn Umm MaktOm to lead the people
in prayers and called Aba Lubibah from Ar-Rawha’ to superintend
Madinah, He gave the white standard to Mug ab itn” Umayr. Two black
flags were in front of the Prophet (pbuh), one with “Ali ibn Abi Talib called
Al-Iqib and the other with one of the Ansar. Only seventy camels were
‘owned by his Companions who rode on each alternatively: the Prophet
(pbuh) with “AIT and Marthad iba Abi Marthad al-Ghanawi on one camel;
‘Hamzah ibn “Abdel-Muualib, Zayd ibn Hirithab, and Abd Kabshah and
Anasah, two mawilds of the Prophet on one; and Ab Bakr, “Umar, und
*Abdur-Rahman ibn “Aw on one camel.

He marched out the road to Makkah by the upper course from Madinah,
going through Al-'Agig, Dhul-Hulayfah, and Uldtul-Jaysh, passing by
Turban, Mall, Ghamisul-Hamim, Sukhayratul-Yamim, and As-Sayailah;
then by the chasm of Ar-Rawha! to Shanukab, Reaching “Irquz-Zabyah,
they met a nomad and asked him about the Quraysh, but he knew nothing.
The people said, "Greet the Messenger of Allah.” He said, “Is he among
you” and when they said he was, he greeted him and said, "If you are the
Messenger of Allah. then tell me what the gut of my she-camel contains
‘Salamah ibn Salimah said to him, "Do not ask the Prophet: come to me and
can tell you about it. You leapt upon her and she is pregnant of a little goat
from you!” The Prophet (pbuh) said. “Stop it? You have spoken obscenely to the
‘oun.’ Then he lett Salama,

The Prophet (pbuh) halted at Sajsaj, the well of Ar-Rawhi: then taveled
to Al-Mungaraf, departing from the road of Makkah leftward, turning to the
right to An-Naziyah heading for Badr. Proceeding in that direction, he
crossed a valley called Rubqdin between An-Naziyah and the strait of
AgSafrd’; then along the strait 0 near Ay-Safrd’. He then sent Basbas ibn
“Ame al-Juhani and “Adiyy ibn Abi az-Zaghb:
news about Abd Sufyéin and his caravan, Having sent them on ahead he
departed.

Reports came to him that the Quraysh had marched to defend their
caravan. He consulted his people. Abd Bake got up and spoke well, Then

“Urwah said that when Az-Zubayr ibnul-Awwam emerged to fight Yasir,

him) kill my son, O Messenger of Allah?” He answered, “But your son will
All him, if Allah wills." Az-Zubayr went out and killed Yasir.

Salamah ibn “Amir ibnul-Akwa* related, "The Prophet (pbuh) sent Abd
Bakr with the standard against some of the Khaybar strongholds. He fought
until he became exhausted and returned without a conquest. Afterwards, he
sent “Umar but with the same results. The Prophet (pbuh) said, "Tomorrow 1
will give the banner 10 a man who loves Allah and his Mesrenger. Allah will over:
come it with his hands, and he never escapes.” Hence the Prophet (pbuh)
‘summoned “Ali who had had problem in his eye at that time, so he (pbuh)
spat in his eye and said, "Take ris standard and proceed with it, until Allah
sgranus you vietory.”

Salamah said, "Alt harried away with it, gasping as he rushed, while we
were behind him following his traces until he fixed the standard in a pile of
stones under the fortress, From the topmost part of the fortress, a Jew
looked down at him and asked, "Who are you?" He replied, "I am “Ali ibn
Abi Talib.” The Jew continued, “You will be granted victory, by what was
sent to Masa!" He did not return until Allah had made the conquest through
his hands. The two strongholds of Khaybar. Al-Warih and As-Sulalim were
besieged by the Prophet (pbuh) until the Jews there were sure of their death
so they asked him to Jet them leave and spare their lives, and he (pbuh)
accepted. He (pbuh) had taken control of all their property, Ash-Shaqg,
‘Nath, and Al-Katibah and all their fortresses except those two strongholds.
When the people of Fadak knew that they had done so, they sent to the
Prophet and asked him to treat them in the same way.

Mubaysah ibn Mas‘Ad, the brother of Band Harithah, was among the
mediators. The people of Khaybar asked for surrender and that the Prophet
(pbuh) would let them undertake their property against a haif share of the
‘output, saying, “We know it better than you and we are better growers.” The
Prophet (pbuh) accepted their proposal but stipulated that "If we wish to exile
ou, we will do it.” He made a similar reconciliation with the people of
Fadak. Thus. Khaybar conceded to the Muslims. while Fadak was fully for

rapidly headed for Makkah.

‘Three days prior to Damdam's arrival, “Atikah the daughter of “Abdul
Muttalib saw a vision which terrified her. She sent for her brother
Al Abbas saying. "O Brother. I had a vision last night which terrified me
and I fear that evil and adversity will afflict your people. So keep what I tell
you as a secret.” He asked what she had seen and she said, "I saw a man
riding a camet who stopped at the valley. He yelled at the top of his voice,
‘Rise, © people, do not let your men confront a calamity that will come in
three days time,’ 1 saw the people gather around him, He then entered the
‘Mosquie and the people followed him, While they were surrounding him his

same words. Afterwards his came! rose to the top of AbO Qubays, be
shouted out again, took a rock and loosened it, which kept on falling down
to the bottom of the mountain where it was divided into small pieces, There
‘was no house of residence in Makkah but got a bit of it.” Al- Abbas said,
“By Allah, verily it is a vision, and you had better conceal it and not
mention it to anyone.” Al--Abbis then met Al-Walid ibn “Uthah who was
his friend. He informed hint about it but asked him to keep it a secret. Yet
Al-Walid told his father and the story prevailed in Makkah so that the
Quraysh were speaking about it in their public assemblies. Al- Abbis said,
“Lwoke up in the morning to circumambulate the House, whereas AbO Jah
was sitting with a group of the Quraysh discussing “Atikah’s vision. When
he saw me he said, ‘After finishing your circumambulation come and join

had done to them, "O Messenger of Allah, what has happened to me is the
same as: what has happened to you,” said Bilil, The Prophet (pbuh)
admitted, "You are right.” Then the Prophet (pbuh) rode his camel for rather
a short distance, where he made it knee!, so that he and the men performed
ablution. He commanded Bilél to call for the prayer. The Prophet (pbub) led
people in the prayer and when they ended it, he approached the people and
Said, "If yuu forget to perform your prayer. perform it once you remember it, for
Allah, Glorified and Exalted be He, says, é..and perform As-Saléh (Iqamat-as-
Salih) for My Remembrance y (Taha: 14)."

T heard that the Prophet (pbuh) provided Ibn Lugaym al Absi with the
chickens or livestock of Khaybar. The conquest was carried out in Safar.

The Arrival of Ja‘ far ibn Abi Talib from Abyssinia
(And a Report on the Migrants to Abyssinia)

Ibn Hishim said from Ash-Shu' abl, “Ja’far ibn Abi Talib came to the
Prophet (pbuh) on the day when he conquered Khaybar. The Prophet (pbuh)
kissed his forehead and hugged him saying, do not know which makes me
happier, the conquest of Khaybar or the arrival of Ja’far.”

Ibn Ishiq said, "Some of the Prophet's (pbuh) Companions remained in
Abyssinia until he dispatched “Amr ibn Umayyah ad-Damii to the Negus to

Madinah with the caravan and the two captives.

‘When they went to the Prophet (pbuih), he said,

"Tad not comma you to fight in the Sacred mnths.”

He retained the curavan and the two prisoners and forbade tking
anything from them. When the Prophet (pbuh). said so, the men felt
desperate and thought they were doomed. The Muslims censured them for
how they acted. The Quraysh said, "Muhammad and his Companions have
permitted (Lighting in) the inviolable month, shedding blood therein, taking
spoils, and imprisoning men.” The Muslims in Makkah who refuted them
said that the whole thing had happened in Sha’ ban.

Al- Abbas ibn “Abdul-Muttalib was the one who married him to ber. The

has ended, so leave us.’ The Prophet (pbuh) answered, 'Why do you mot let me
stay to wed among you and prepare «feast for you to attend? They said, "We do

retumed to Madinah without fighting, and stayed there for the rest of
Rabrul-Akhir and a part of Jumida al-O1a.

The Invasion on Al-* Ushayrah

The Prophet (phub) invaded the Quraysh through the path of Band
Dinar, Fayfiul-Khabir, and stopped under a tree at the valley of Ibn Azhir
where he offered prayer and founded his mosque. Food was prepared and he
ate accompanied by those who were with him. The site of the stones of his
cooking-pot is still known. He drank from the water of a place called
Al-Mushtarab. Then he departed Al-Khalitig leftward in the direction of a
glen called Shi*bat “Abdullih; then to the left again until he went down to
Yalyal and stopped at its crossing with Ad-Dabu ah. He drank from the well
at Ad-Dabu’ah traversing the plain of Malal until he met the track in
Sukhayrit al-Yamam straight to Al“Ushayrah in the valley of Yanbu’
where he stayed throughout the month of Jumada al-Ola and some days of
the following month. He made a pact of peace there with Band Mudlij and
their allies Bano Damrah, and retumed to Madinah without a fight.

The Expedition of Sa’d ibn Abi Waqqas.

‘At the same time, the Prophet (pbuh) sent Sa°d_ ibn Abi Waqaas with
eight men of the Muhajirtin, who reached Al-Kharrar in Al-Hijiiz. They to
returned without fighting.

The Invasion on Safawan,

the First Invasion of Badr
After the invasion on Al-'Ushayrah, the Prophet (pbuh) had stayed less
than ten nights in Madinah when Kurz ibn Jabir al-Fihri raided the grazing
camels of Madinah. The Prophet (pbuh) pursued him, until he reached a

valley called Safawan, in the direction of Badr. Kurz fled and could not be
caught. This was the first invasion of Badr. Afterwards, the Prophet (pbuh)

with it until when he was in the heart of the battle with no way out, he
alighted his roan horse, hamstrung it, and resumed fighting until he was killed,

Ibn Hishim said, “A scholar whom I trust told me that Jafar held the
standard first in his right hand, but it was cut off, so he seized it with his left
hhand which was also cut off. Then he clasped it to his breast with his arms
until he was killed. He was thirty-three years of age. Consequently, Allah
rewarded him with two wings in Paradise with which he flew wherever he
wished. It was said that a Roman warrior struck him, cutting him a sunder.”

Ton Ishig said that after the killing of Ja'far, “Abdullah ibn Rawahah
held the standard and stepped forward with it while riding his horse. He had
to repress himself as he felt hesitant to proceed, but he blamed himself and
g0t off. Then his cousin offered him a meat bone, saying, "Support yourself
with this, for you have suffered a lot in these difficult days.” He took a little
bite, but when he heard the sounds of disorder and crowd in the army, he
hurled it away, saying to himself. "Are you (still living) in this world?” He
gripped his sword, advanced, and fought until he was killed. Then Thabit
ibn Agram the brother of Band AlAjlin took the standard. He cried out,
“O Muslims, come together round a man of you." They said, "You (be this
man).” But he objected so they rallied to Khalid ibnul-Walld. As he took the
standard, he parried the enemy to avoid an encounter, Then he withdrew and
the enemy averted from him until he retreated with the army.

According to what has reached me, when the army was crushed the
Prophet (pbuh) said, "Zavd held the standard and fought with it until he was
Ailled as a martyr; then Safar wok it and fought with it until he was killed as a
‘martyr." Then be (pbuh) kept silent, so the faces of the Ansir changed color
for they thought that some mischief had happened to “Abdullah ibn
Rawiah. Yet he continued, "Then “Abdullah ihn Rawahah held it and fought
with it until he was killed as a martyr.” Then be said, "They were carried up to
me in Paradise, as | saw ina vision, on beds of gold. | saw “Abdullah's bed turning
aside from the beds of his two fellows (i.e. Zayd and Ja’ far). When I asked for the
reason, | was told that they moved on (without hesitation) but he wavered before
he moved on.”

When they attacked them at Al-Watir at night they killed Munabbah, a
man who had a weak heart. He told Tamim ibn Asad who accompanied
‘him, to flee for he was sure that he would die, whether they killed him or set
hhim free, since he had a problem in his heart. Hence, Tamim managed 10
escupe, while Munabbah was caught and killed. On entering Makkah the
Khuzitah resorted to the house of Budayl ibn Warga’ and that of an ally of
theirs called Rafi".

With the attacks of the Quraysh and Band Bakr against The Khuza°ah
Killing some of them, they were in fact violating their treaty with the
Prophet (pbuh) through their aggressive attitude towards the Khuzit'ah who
were in bond with him. Under this situation, “Ame ibn Salim al-Khuza'f and
‘one of Band Ka’b went to the Prophet (pbuh) in Madinah. That was among

‘Together with a band of the Khuz3'ah, Budayl ibn Warqa’ went to the
Prophet (pbuh) in Madinah to inform him of their affliction anid how the
Quraysh were supporting Banfi Bakr against them. After meeting him they
returned to Makkah. The Prophet (pbuh) had said to them, “It seems that you
will see Abit Sufyén coming to reinforce the treaty and extend its term.” When
Budayl and his companions had reached “Usfan they met Abi Sufyan ibn
Harb, who had been dispatched by the Quraysh to reinforce the treaty with
the Prophet (pbuh) and to make an extension, as they feared the outcome of
what they had done. When Abd Sufyfin saw Budayl, he asked him from
where he was coming, as he suspected that he had been to the Prophet
(pbuh). He answered that he had been moving with the Khucét ah along that
coast and at the bottom of that valley, while he denied that he had been to
Mubammad (pbuh), when he had asked him so. Budayl had continued wo

Suspected that “AIT might have been fooling him and all what he had done
‘was useless, He said, “By Allah, I found nothing else to do.”

The Prophet (pbuh) gave orders to the Muslims to prepare for an
mvasion. Abé Bakr was visiting his daughter “A’ishah who was making the
Preparations. When he asked her about the place they were to go, she told
‘him that she did’ not know. Later the Prophet (pbuh) announced that he was
going to Makkah and ordered them to be ready. He said, “O Allah, rake away
‘the spies and news from the Quraysh so that we may take them by surprise in their
land.” The array got ready.

‘When the Prophet (pbuh) determined to march to Makkah, Hatib ibn Abi
Balta‘ah wrote a message to the Quraysh to tell them about the Prophet's
decision to raid them. He gave it to a womai to whom he paid some money
to convey it to the Quraysh. She put it on ber hed, then plaited her braid
over it and left, The Prophet (pbuh) received a report from heaven of Hatib’s
deed. Thus, he summoned “Ali ibn Abi Talib and Az-Zubayr ibnul- Awwam
and said, "Go after a woman with whom there is a letter from Hatib ibn Abi Bal-
‘a'ah 10 the Quraysh warning them of our decision against them.” They overtook
her in Al-Khaligah of Bani’ Abd Abmad. Making her get down, they looked
into her baggage but found nothing. “Ali swore by Allah to her that the
Prophet was never to be misinformed nor were they, and that if she did not
give the letter they would strip her, When she found him serious, she told
them to wim aside. She undid her braids and gave the letter to him, When
the Prophet (pbuh) got the letter from him, he called Hatib and asked him,
“What induced you to do so?" He said, "By Allah, | believe in Allah and His
Messenger and my belief has never changed, But Lam a man of no position

A Report on Those of the Prophet's Companions
Who Suffered from Fever:

shah (may Allah be pleased with her) said, "When the Prophet
(pbub) arrived at Madinuh, it was the most place plagued with fever on
arth. It infected his Companions who suffered 4 severe affliction. Yet,
Allah kept it from His Prophet. Abd Bakr's mawlds, “Amir ibn Fuhayrah
and Bildl, were with him in one house when the fever attacked them. T went
to nurse them, for that was before the veil had been prescribed for women.
Only Allah knows how much they were agonized from fever. T approached
‘my father and asked hit how he was doing. He answered,

‘Any man might be greeted by his family in the morning
While death was nearer than the thong of his sandal.

I said, ‘By Allah, my father does not know what he is saying.’ Then 1
went to Amir and asked the sume question. He said,

I have experienced death before actually tasting it:
‘The coward's death comes upon him as he sits.
Every man resists it with all his might

Like the ox that protects his body with his horns

I said, "By Allah “Amir does not know what he is saying.’ Bilal, when the
fever swayed him, lay down on the ground of the house, and raised his voice
saying.

white mule, I reached Al-Arik, as I thought I might find some woodcutters,
milkers, or anyone who could go to the people of Makkah to tell them about
the Prophet (pbuh) so that they could ask for protection before he entered
the place by force. While having such an intention, I heard the voice of AbG
‘Sufyn and Budayl speaking to each other. Ab Sufyn was saying, ‘I have
Never seen such fires and camping before.’ ‘By Allah, it must be the
Khuzi’'ah coming for war, answered Budayl. Aba Sufyan said, "The
Khuzit‘ah are too trivial and few to have such fires and camps.’ Thus T knew
hhim by his voice as well as he did. I told him about the Prophet (pbuh) and
his army, and showed concern for him and for the Quraysh, ‘If he reaches
‘you he will cut off your head, so mount on the back of this mule and I will
take you to him and ask safety for you.’ He sat behind me, while his two
companions went back.

Passing by the Muslim fires, they first became alert, wandering who we
were but calmed down saying that it was the Prophet's mule ridden by his
uncle. Until we were alongside “Umar's fire, he saw Abd Sufyiin on the back
of the mule and cried our, "Abii Sufydn the enemy of Allah! Thanks to Allah

Establishing Brotherhood
between the Muhajiran and the Ansar

Tbn Ishq said, “The Prophet (pbuh) established mutual brotherhood
between his Companions of the Muhdjirin and the Angir. According to
‘hail has reached me. and T seek Allah's protection from attributing to him
words that he did not say, he said, "Be brothers in Allah, pair by pair.” He held
the hand of “Ali ibn Abi Talib and said. ‘This is my brother.’ The Messenger
‘of Allah, was the master of the Messengers and Imam of those who are
conscious of Allah, the Messenger of the Lord of the Worlds, and the
peerless and incomparable. He and “Ali ibn Abi Talib became brothers.
‘Hamzah ibn “Abdel-Muttalib, the lion of Allah arid His Messenger, and the
uncle of the Prophet, became the brother of Zayd ibn Harithah, the Prophet's
‘mawla. Hamzah bequeathed to Zayd on the Battle of Uhud, in case of his
death, Ja’far ibn Abi Talib “the one of the two wings, and the flier (in
Paradise)" and Mu*idh ibn Jabal the brother of Thn Salamah became
brothers.

‘The pairs were as follows:

‘Abd Bakr and Khirijah ibn Zuhayr; “Umar ibnul-Khattab and “bin ibn
Malik; Abi “Ubaydah ibnul-Jarrah and Sa'd ibn Mu'Adh; “Abdur-Rahmain

continued, ‘And he who shuts his door is safe, and he who enters the
Mosque is safe’. Then the people diffused to different directions, to their
hhouses and the Mosque.”

“Abdulléh ibn Abi Bakr related that when the Prophet stopped at Dh
Tuwa, he was riding his beast wearing a turban of red Yemeni cloth, When
he saw how Allah had honored him with victory, he lowered his head in
humility to Allah until his beard almost touched the middle of the saddle,
‘Asm! the daughter of Abd Bakr related that when the Prophet (pbult) halted
in Dd Tuwa, AbO Quhifah asked one of his youngest daughters, to take
him up to Abd Qubays (a mountain in Makkah). He had almost lost his
sight, so when they ascended he asked her what she could see. "A block of
blackness,” she said. “It is the cavalry,” he said. Then she told him that she
was seeing a man running up and down in front of them. He said, "O
daughter, it is the adjutant," i.e. the one who gives and forwards the orders
to the cavalry. Then she said, “By Allah, the blackness has diffused," He
said, "Therefore the cavalry has been set free, so hurry and escort me to my
house.” While she was taking him down, the cavalry met them before
reaching his house. As the girl was wearing a silver necklace, a man
encountered her and tore it from her neck. When the Prophet (pbuh) entered
the Mosque, Abd Bakr went to him leading his father. On seeing him the
Prophet (pbuh) said, "Why did you nor leave the old man in his house and let me
0 10 him there?” Aba Bakt replied, "It is he who should come to you". He
made him sit before him and stroked his breast and asked him to embrace
Islam and he did so. When Aba Bakr accompanied his father who was
‘white-haired, the Prophet (pbuh) told them to change that grayness of the
hair for him. Then Abi Bakr got up, held his sister's hand, and said, “I
implore by Allah and Islam for my sister's necklace". No one answered him,
so he said, "O little sister, save the reward for your necklace with Allah, for
honesty is rare among people nowadays.”

The slogan of the Prophet's Companions on the days of Makkah,
‘Hunayo, and AL-TAf: for the Muhdjirtn was "O Band “Abdur-Rahman”, for
the Khazraj, "0 Band “Abdulliih”, and for the Aws, “O Band “Ubaydillah”.
The Prophet (pbuh) gave instructions to the Muslim leaders when entering
Makkah not to fight, except certain individuals who must be killed even if
they were found under the curtains of the Ka’bah. Among them was

te write down the Revelation for the Prophet (pbub) but he apostatized and
returned to the Quraysh, He resorted to “Uthmin ibn *Affin who was his
foster-brother, He concealed him until the conditions in Makkah settled and
then he brought him to the Prophet (pbuh), asking if he might be granted
safety. Some said that the Prophet (pbuh) kept silent for a long time until
finally he said yes, When “Uthiian had gone he said to his Companions who
were there, “remained silent so that one of you might rise and behead him!
‘One of the Ansar said, "Then why did you not give me « hint, © Messenger

‘Another one to be killed was “Abdullah ibn Khajal of Band Tayyim iba

some food, and then he slept. When he awoke the mawid had done nothing,

Al-Huwayrith ibn Naqaydh was killed by “Alt iba Abi Talib.

Umm Hani’ the daughter of Abd Tilib said, "When the Prophet (pbuh)
stayed in the upper part of Makkah, two of my brothers-in-law of Bani

‘Safiyyah the daughter of Shaybah related that, being in Makkab after the

Karbah seven times on his camel touching the Comer with his rod.
‘Afterwards he called “Uthmin ibn ‘Talhah to take the key of the Kabah
from him. When the Ka'bah was opened for him, he found a wooden pigeon
Which he broke with his hands and hurled it away. Standing by the gate of
the Ka'bah, the people were assembled with him in the Mosque.

Thagif, all the people of Nass and Jusham, Sa°d ibm Bakr, and a few from

‘camels, asses, children, and sheep?” They told him that Malik had taken
them with the army. He at once summoned him and said, “O Malik, you
have become the leader of your people and this is a day which will be
ensued by events.” He then questioned him about the sounds he was
hearing, and Malik explained his point in bringing them to stay behind the
warriors so that they would fight without
‘of denial, he said, "You shepherd, by Allah do you think that anything will
change the state of a defeated man? In case things go well nothing will help
but a man with a sword and a spear, in case it goes against you, you will be

when he knew of their absence, he said, “Boldness and might are absent; if

that you had acted the same as they did. Whom of your clans are witnessing

‘your horses. In case the fight is in your advantage, those behind can proceed

people of Hawézin, you will either follow me, or will kill myself with this
sword.” He could not stand Durayd’s having any position in the matter. As
the Hawazin said that they would obey Malik, Durayd said, “This is a day

Al’ Abbiis ibn *Abdel-Muttalib said, "T'was with the Prophet (pbuh)
seizing the rein of his white mule which I had put between its jaws. Twas a
large man with a sonorous voice. The Prophet (pbuh) said to his army, as it
was in chaos, 'Where are you (going), O people” but none of them seemed to
have heard, He asked me to cry out loudly, 'O Ansar, O Companions of As-
Samurai’, They replied, ‘Here we are at your service’. One of them would try
to reverse his camel, but he could not do it, so: he would take his armor, cast
it on its neck, take his sword and shield, dismount it, setting it free while he
followed the voice until he reached the Prophet (pbuh). Eventually a
tundred warriors gathered around him, proceeded, and fought.

The call was first directed to the Ansir and then to the Khazraj. They
were firm in the battlefield, while the Prophet (pbuh) stood in his stirrups
watching the fight as they were challenging and said, ‘Now the battle has
‘grown fierce.’ ”

Jabir ibn “Abdillah related, "Alt ibn Abi Talib and an Ansari attucked the
‘man who was carrying the banner of the Hawazin on his camel, “Ali care
on him from the back and hamstrung his camel so it fell upon its rear end;
the Ansirt jumped upon him and struck him a blow which made his foot fly
with half of his shank and he dropped from his saddle. The warriors did
their best in the fight. By Allah, when those who had withdrawn came back,
they found prisoners fettered with the Prophet (pbuh).”

The Prophet (pbuh) directed to Abd Sufyan ibnul-Harith ibn
*Abdel-Mattalib, who was among those who stood firm with him (pbuh)
that day, and he had become a good Muslim after embracing Istam. Aba
Sufyn was holding to the posterior of the saddle of the Prophet's mule. He
asked who it was. He said, "It is me, the son of your mother, O Messenger
of Allah.”

“Abdullah ibn Abi Bakr related that the Prophet (pbuh) found Umm
Sulaym the daughter of Milhin with her husband Abj Talhah. She was
banding a girdle as she was pregnant with her son “Abdulla ibn talhab. She
was riding her husband's camel and in order to control it she brought its
head close to her, putting her hand in the nose ring of hair along with the
nose bridle. After the Prophet (pbuh) had recognized her, she said, "O
Messenger of Allah, kill those who fled from you as you kill those who:
combat you, for they deserve that!” The Prophet (pbuh) said, “fs & not thar
Allah suffices (me) for them, O Umm Sulaym?” She had a dagger with her so
when AbG Talhah asked her why she carried it, she said, “I took the dagger

"Do you hear, O Messenger of Allah, what Ar-Rumaysi’ (who had a
problem in her eyes) is saying!”

Abi Qatadah said, "On the day of Hunayn I saw a Muslim and a
polytheist fighting. Another polytheist came to help his companion against
the Muslim, so I made for him and cut off his hand, but he griped me with
the other hand; and by Allah if it was not for his bleeding, he would have

killed me, but he fell down and I killed him: 1 was too indulged in the battle
to pay any more heed to;him. One of the people of Makkah passed by and
footed him, When the war was over, the Prophet (pbuh) said, ‘Ler whoever
tilled a person take his booty." 1 said, ‘O Messenger of Allah (pbuh) T have
slain a person who was worth looting but I was extremely occupied in the
battle at the time so I did not see who had spoiled him.’ One of the people of
Makkah admitted that 1 had spoken the truth and said that the booty was
with him and asked the Prophet (pbuh) to pay me to my satisfaction on his
behalf from my spoil. Abd Bakr said, 'No, by Allah, he shall not give him
from it to his satisfaction. Do you want to make one of Allah's lions who
fought for His religion share you in his booty? Give him back the spoils of
the one he had killed!" The Prophet (pbuh) said that AbO Bakr’s had said the
truth, and ordered that man to give me my booty back. I took the booty. sold
it. and purchased with the money a small palm-grove. It was the first
property I ever owned.”

Tn Ishaq said that when the Hawizin were defeated. many of the men of
‘Thagif among Band Milik were killed, and seventy of them were killed
under their standard, among whom were “Uthmin ibn “Abdillah ibn Rabialt
ibnel-Harith ibn Habib. Their standard was first with a man known as
Dbul-Khimér!"”, When he was stain, “Uthmin ibn “Abdillah took it until he
was also killed.

[As the polytheists were beaten they went to At-T#if, accompanied by
Malik ibn “Awf: while some encamped in Aw4is, and only Band Ghiyarah
from Thagif made for Nakhlah, The Muslim cavalry pursued those who had
headed for Nakhlah, but they did not chase those who had gone to the hillocks.

‘The Prophet (pbuh) dispatched Abd “Amir al-Ash‘ari to follow the
traces of those in Avis and he caught some of them running away. In the
‘engagement Abd “Amir was speared with an arrow and died so his cousin,
‘Aba Misa al-Ash'ari, took the standard, and kept on fighting until Allah
granted him victory.

During their flight, Malik ibn “Awf with some of his horsemen stopped
‘at a hillock on the way to wait for their weak to pass and those in the back to
join them. The Prophet (pbuh) was passing by when he found the men

gathered around a woman whom Khalid iboul-Walid had killed. He at once
sent a message to Khilid saying "The Messenger of Allah forbids sou from kll-
ing a baby, woman, ora hired slave.”

The Prophet (pbuh) said that day, “If you can earch Bijéd - a man of Bani
Sa’d ibn Bakr ~ do not let him run away from you," for he had made some evil
act, When the Muslims seized him they took him away with his family and
‘Ash-Shayma’ the daughter of Al-Harith who was a foster-sister of the
Prophet (pbuh). They were tough with her on their way. When she told them
that she was a foster-sister of the Prophet (pbuh), they did not believe her.
‘They took her to the Prophet,

When she told the Prophet (pbuh) that she was his foster-sister, he asked
her to prove her claim. She said that he bit her in the back when she was
carrying him on her hip. The Prophet (pbuh) remembered that, so he
stretched out his mantle for her to sit on, He made her choose between
living with him in endearment and honor or returning to her people with
prevents, and she preferred the latter. Band Sa’d claimed that he also gave
her a bondman of his called Makhal, and a bondwoman whom she gave to
the former in marriage and their progeny continued.

Ibn Hisham said, "Allah revealed concerning the Day of Hunayn,

4 Truly Allah has given you victory on many bautle fields. and on the
Day of Hunayn (battle) when you rejoiced at your great number but it availed you
naught and the earth, vast as it 1s, was straitened for you, then you turned back in
flight. Then Allah did send down His Sakinah (calmness, tranquillity and re-
‘assurance, etc.) on the Messenger (Muhammad), and on the believers, and sent
down forces (angels) which you saw not, and punished the dishelievers. Such is the
recompense of dishelievers. >

(At-Tawbah: 25-26)

Tha Ishiiq said, “The captives and spoils of Hunayn were collected to the
Prophet (pbuh). Mas'dd ibn “Ame al-Ghifirt was in charge of the spoils’
affairs. The Prophet (pbuh) ordered that all the captives and spoils be kept in
Al-diaranah.”

The Invasion of At-Ta'if, 8 AH

When the defeated subjects of Thagif arrived at At-TA%f, they closed the
gates of the city and prepared themselves for war. “Urwah ibm Mas'6d and
Gaylan ibn Salamah did not witness the Battle of Hunayn nor the siege of
‘At-TAif, for they were training in Jirash on how to. use the testudo, the
‘catapult, and other equipment,

‘After finishing with Hunayn, the Prophet (pbuh) made for ALT#if. He
marched and passed by Nakhlat al-Yaminiyyah, Qum, Al-Mulayh, and by
Bohrat ar-Rughd’ of Liyyah, where he built a mosque offered prayer therein.
“Then he proceeded on the Ad-Dayqah road to Nakhb until he stopped under
a lote tree called As-Sidirah close to the property of a man of Thaqif. The
Prophet (pbuh) sent hin a message asking him whether to surrender or be
would destroy his garden. He refused to surrender so the Prophet (pbuh)
‘gave orders to demolish it

‘The Prophet (pbuh) continued until be stopped near At-Tif where he
encamped. Yet the Muslims’ camps were too close to the wall of At-T8'if so
some of the Companions were killed by arrows which reached them from
the wall, and the Muslims could not enter the wall because the enemy had
fortified themselves behind it, When those Muslims died, the Prophet
(pbuh) moved the camp to where his Mosque at ALTA if is today. He (pbuh)
besieged AL-TA'f for more than twenty nights

‘Two of the Prophet's wives accompanied him, one of them was Umm
Salamah the daughter of Abi Umayyah. He pitched for them two tents
between which he offered prayers. He remained there until Thagif
surrendered, so “Amr ibn Umayyah ibn Wahb constructed a mosque over
the site where he (pbuh) used to perform prayer. It was said that there was @
pillar in the masque that made a sound every time the sun rose over it.
‘During the siege, the fight was bitter and the two parties exchanged arrows,
until AL-TSif Wall was attacked by a band of the Companions who
penetrated under a testudo encroaching to the wall .o bum it, Thagif threw
‘on them molten hot iron so they stepped out from under it and were shot by
arrows which killed some of them. The Praphet (pbuh) commanded that the
vineyards of Thagif be cut down.

1 was told that the Prophet (pbuh) said to Ab@ Bakr during the siege of
ALTSif, that he had seen (in-a vision) that he was given a bow! of butter
and a cock pecked at it and split its contents, Abd Bakr commented that he
did not think that the Prophet (pbuh) would achieve what he desired from
them that day. He (pbuh) ssid that he did not think that either. Then
Khuwaylah the daughter of Hakim of Sulaym and the wife of “Uthmin ibn
Maz’in, went to the Prophet (pbih) and asked him to give her the jewelry
of Bidiyah the daughter of Ghaylan, or that of Al-Pari'ah the daughter of
“Ligayl, in case Allah granted him vietory over A-TAjf, for both were from
the most bejeweled women of Thagif. Some told me that the Prophet's
answer was, 'What if Thagif is not permitted to me, O Kluswaylah® She went out
‘and repeated the Prophet's words to "Umar, who went to the Prophet (pbuh) to
make sure thiat he had said so. Knowing that he had, he asked if they should
depart. The Prophet (pbuh) gave him permission to give orders to break
‘camp, and he did so.

When the troops moved off Sa'td ibn “Ubayd cried out, “The clan is
staying." “Uyaynah ibn Hign said, "Yes, with glory and honor”. One of the
‘Muslims said to him, "May Allah's Curse be upon you, O “Uyaynah! Do
you glorify the polytheists for holding out against the Messenger of Allah
although you have joined him to fight with him?" “I did not come with you
to be against Thaqif,” he answered, "but I wanted Muhammad to control
AL-TAif so that T might get a Thagif girl who might give birth to a son of
mine, for the people of Thagif are intelligent and clever.”

During the Prophet's stay, some slaves who were under siege in A-Ta'if
went to him and embraced Islam and he emancipated them. When the
people of At-T8'if accepted Islam, some of them like Al-Hérith ibn Kaladah
asked for these slaves, but the Prophet (pbuh) said that they were Allah's
freed men. Twelve of the Prophet's Companions were killed as martyrs at
ArTaif: seven from the Quraysh, four from the Ansar, and one from Band
Layth. The Prophet (pbuh) departed At-TA'f after the hattle and the siege.

The Property and Captives of the Hawazin
and the Division of the Spoils

Moving off from At-Ta‘if, the Prophet (pbuh) with his army went
through Dhné until he halted at Al-Ji'rinah, where a large number of the

Hawazin captives were kept. One of his Companions, on their departure
from Thagif asked the Prophet (pbuh) to supplicate against them but he sid,
“O Allah, guide Thagif and bring them (i.e. to Islam or to himn),”

A deputation from the Hawazin went to him at Al-Jirinah where he
retained six thousand women and children, and a countless number of sheep
and camels. They said they were an established clan but affliction had
befallen them, as was well known, and implored him to pity them for
‘Allah's sake. One of the Hawazin from the clan of Band Sa’d ibn Bakr
named Zuhayr and dubbed Abd surad said, "O Messenger of Allah, in the
pens are your paternal and maternal aunts and your foster mothers.’ Had it
been that we suckled Al-Harith ibn Abi Shamir or An-Nu'man
ibnul-Mundhir (two high personalities) and they were in your position now,
we would hope for their pity und generosity, but still you are the best of
entrusted men.”

‘The Prophet (pbuh) gave them the choice between their families and
property. When they chose their families, the Prophet (pbuh) said, “Whar is
‘for me and for Bani ‘Abdul-Magalib is yours, When 1 finish the Ziuhr prayer with
the people, get up and say. We ask the intercession of the Messenger of Allah with
the Muslims, and that of the Muslims with the Messenger of Allah for our children
and wives’. [will then give you (what you ask for) and appeal on your behalf.”

‘The Prophet (pbuh) having finished the Zuhr prayer. they did as he
instructed them and he said, "What is for me and for Banti “Abdul-Muttalib is
yours.” The Muhdjirdn said "And what is ours is for the Prophet"; and the
‘Ansir said the same. However, Al-Aqra’ ibn Habis said. “What is mine and
that of Band Tamim are not (ic, are ours not for the Prophet).” “Uyaynah
ibn Hign said the same about what was his and that of Band Fazarah. When
“Abbas ibn Mirdis said the same about what was his and that of Band
Sulaym, the latter said, "What is ours is for the Prophet", Thereupon,
“Abbas said to Band Sulaym "You have belittled me." Then the Prophet
(pbuh) said, “He who sticks to his right to these prisoners will have six camels for
‘every person from the first booty 1 get. Then let the men have their wives and chil-
dren back.”

‘The Prophet (pbuh) inquired of the Hawazin deputation about Malik ibn

(pbuh) told them to inform Malik that in case he came to him us a Muslim,
he would give him buck his family and property plus a hundred camels.
Milik accepted the proposal and left At-Ia'if. Yet he was apprehensive that
‘Thagif would detain him on knowing what the Prophet (pbuh) had said, so
he ordered that his camel should be prepared for him as well as his horse be
brought to him in A-TAif, At night he departed on his horse, and galloped
until he reached the location where his camel was tied, and then he rode off
and joined the Prophet (pbuh) in Al-Ji'rinah or Makkah, The Prophet
(pbuh) retumed his family and property to him and provided him with a
hundred camels. He embraced Istam and became a good Muslim.

‘The Prophet (pbuh) appointed him as a commander over those who had
‘embraced Islam from his people, namely, the tribes of Thumalah, Salamah,
and Fahm. He kept on fighting and raiding Thagif with thera until they became
in sore circumstance. Aba Mibjan ath-Thagifi condemned Malik for this.

‘The people followed the Prophet (pbuh) saying, “O Messenger of Allah,
distribute our booty of camels and herds among us", until they drove him
back against a tree. His mantle was snatched from him, so he said, "O peo-
ple! Return to me my mantle, by Allah if your sheep were as many as the trees of
Tikdmah 1 would divide them among you. You have never found me a miser, cow-
ard, or a liar’. He picked a hair from bis camel's hump and held it high
between his two fingers, saying, "O people. I have nothing but a fifth of your
spoils even to this hair, and the fifth will go back to you. So return (event) threads
and needles, for betrayal (with regard to spoils) will be a shame and a fire and ut-
ter disgrace to those who practice it on the Day of Resurrection.” One of the
‘Anséir appeared with a ball of camel hair, saying, “O Messenger of Allah, |
have taken this ball to make a cushion for an injured camel of mine.” He
replied, “As for my share from it, it is yours!” "If it has come to that, 1 do not
need it,” he said and threw it away.

‘The Prophet (pbuh) provided booty to the new converts to Islam, who
were celebrities and chiefs, to win their hearts and win their people through
them. The following got one hundred camels each: AbG Sufyain ibn Harb;
his son Mu" awiyah; Hakim ibn Hizdm; Al-Hérith ibnul-Harith ibn Kaladah;
Suhayl ibn “Amr; Huwaytib ibn “Abdel“Uzza: Al“ Ala’ ibn Jériyah

Each of following men of the Quraysh were given less than one hundred
‘camels: Makhramah ibn Nawfal a2-Zuhri; “Umayr ibn Wahb al-Jumahi; and
Hisham ibn Amr the brother of Band “Amir ibn Lu’ayy. I do not memorize
‘what he (pbuti) gave them exactly but I knew that he gave them less than
‘one hundred camels. The Prophet (pbuh) gave fifty camels to Sa'id ibn

camels, so he became disappointed and blamed the Prophet (pbuh).

‘The Prophet (pbuh) said, “Take him away from me and cut off his tongue,”
so he was given (camels) until he was pleased; that was what the Prophet
(pbuti) meant by cutting his tongue off.”

[Aba Sa‘id al-Khudri said, "As the Prophet (pbuh) divided this booty

The Story of Ka’ b ibn Zuhayr after the Departure
from At-Ta'if

‘The Prophet (pbuh) was in Madinah after finishing with AL-TS'if, when
Bujayr ibn Zuhayr ibn Abf Sula sent a fetter to his brother Ka'b warning
him that the Prophet (pbuh) had killed some men in Makkah who had
satirized and insulted him, while the Qurayshi poets who were still alive like
Thnuz- Zib'ard and Hubayrah ibn Abt Wahb had escaped in all directions.
“If you are still keen about your life, then hurry to the Prophet (pbuh), for he
does not kill those who go to him repentant. If you will not do that, rescue
yourself to any place on earth in which you feel safe.” Kab had said,

Give Bujayr a message from me:

Do you accept what I said? Confound you!

Tell us plainly if you do not accept what I say

For what reason other than that has ted you

To a religion I cannot find his fathers ever held

‘And you cannot find that your brother followed?

If you do not accept what I say, I shall not grieve
Nor say if you stumble: Allah help you!

Al-Ma'man (the safe) has given you full cup to drink:
And added a second draught of the same.

He sent these poetic verses to Bujayr who felt that he should recite them
to the Prophet (pbuh). On hearing the words "Al-Ma'mtin (the safe) has
given you a full cup” he said, "That is right, although he is surely a liar, Fam
AbMa'min.* Commenting on the words “to a religion 1 cannot find his
fathers ever held.” the Prophet (pbuh) said, "Sure, neither his father nor mother
eld it”

bn Ishaq said that when Ka’b received the message he was deeply
frightened and worried about his life. His foes around him spread rumors
that he would definitely be slain. Being in an inescapable situation, Kab
‘wrote & poem praising the Prophet (pbuh) and referring to his fear and the

QQ


<br><br><br>

disturbing rumors of his enemies. Afterwards, he headed for Madinah and
stayed with a man of Juhaynah whom he knew, as it was mentioned to me.
In the morning, be took him to the Prophet (pbuh) at the time of the morning
prayer and offered prayer with him. The man pointed out the Prophet (pbuh)
to him and told him (0 go and ask for safety. He got up, walked to the
Prophet (pbuh), sat before him, and put his hand in his, while the Prophet
(pbuh) did not know him. Kab said, “O Messenger of Allah, if Kab ibn
Zuhayr comes to ask you for safety as a repenting Muslim, will you accept
him?” The Prophet (pbuh) said yes so he declared that he was Ka’b ibn
Zubayr.

Tho Ishq said that “Asim ibn “Umar ibn Qatédah told him that one of the
‘Ansar jumped on him asking the Prophet (pbuh) to permit him to cut off his
head calling him the enemy of Allah. The Prophet (pbuh) drew him away
saying that Ka'b had come repentant, and detached from his past. Ka'b was
annoyed at the clan of this Ansiri for what the latter had done. As for the
Muhdjirin, they only spoke well of him, He recited a poem of his starting
with "Sud is gone, and today my heart is love-sick", when hie came to the
Prophet (pbuh), in which he praised him (pbuh) as well as the Muhijiran.

*Asim ibn “Umar ibn Qatadsh said, "When Ka’b said (in a part of this
poem), ‘When the short black men take to flight,’ he was denoting us. we the
Angir, because of the way that man of us had treated him, He praised the
‘Muhajicin only among the Prophet's Companions. This infuriated the Ansir
against him. Later when he had embraced Islam, he praised the Ansiir.
‘mentioning their trials with the Messenger of Allah (pbuh) and their status
among the Yemeni tribes.”

According to Thn Hisham, itis said that after Ka’ had recited to him the
poem starting with "Su'ad is gone, and today my heart is love-sick", the
Prophet (pbuh) said to him, “? wish you spoke well of the Ansar, for they deserve
iit” Thus Ka'b said these verses (of the second poem). Ibn Hishdm also said
that “Ali ibn Zayd ibn Jud’n said that Ka°b recited the poem (starting with
“Su’fid is gone") to the Prophet (pbuh) in the Mosque.

The Invasion of Tabak, 9 AH

‘The Prophet (pbuh) spent the months from Dhul-Hijjah to Rajab in
Madinah, and then ordered the people to prepare to invade the Byzantines.
The events of Tabik are based on narrations from Az-Zuhri, Yazid ibn
Raman, Abdullah ibn Abi Bakr, “Asim ibn “Umar ibn Qatiidah, and other
scholars. Each narrated what he was informed about this invasion, and the
narrations of some of them contained information that was not contained by
those of the others.

‘The Prophet (pbuh) ofdered his Companions to prepare to fight the
Byzantines at a time of hardship. The weather was extremely hot and there
was a drought. Fruit had ripened and the men wished to sit under the shade
of their fruit and hated the thought of traveling at that time, Almost the
Prophet (pbuh) referted indirectly to the place of any invasion and declared
that he would head for a place. which was other than that which he had
actually intended. Tabak was an exception, as he said clearly that he would
go to the Byzantines, That was because of the long distance. the hot season,
and the potency of the enemy, and so that the men could prepare themselves
well; thus he gave orders for preparations.

One day while making his arrangements. the Prophet (pbuh) said to
Al-Jadd ibn Qays of Band Salamah, "O Judd, do you like to fight Banit AlAgar
(Byzantine) this year?” He answered, "O Messenger of Allah, exempt me
from fighting and do not put me into trial, for everyone knows that I am
strongly addicted to women and I fear that I can not control myself if 1 see
the women of Band Al-Asfar.” The Prophet (pbuh) turned away from him
and gave him permission to stay behind. Regarding Al-Jadd ibn Qays, the
following verse was revealed,

And among them is he who says: "Grant me leave (to be exempted
‘from Jia) and put me not into trial.” Surels, they have fallen into trial.
‘And verily, Hell is surrounding the disbelievers.

(AtTawbah: 49)

‘The meaning of this was not that he feared the temptation of the women
of Bandi Al-Asfar, for he had fallen into a greater trial by lagging behind the

Ton Ishq said that the Prophet (pbuh) proceeded actively with his
reparations and communded the men to hasten while urging the rich to help
in providing expenses and mounts in the way of Allah. ‘The wealthy men
provided mounts and so stored a reward with Allah, Othman ibn “Affan
‘spent the Largest sum.

‘Seven Muslims from the Ansir and Band “Amr ibn “Awf, who were
referred to as the Weepers, went to the Prophet (pbuh) and asked him 10
supply them with mounts for they were impoverished. The Weepers were:
Salim ibn “Umayr; “Ulbah ibn Zayd, the brother of Bund Harithah; Abd
Layla" Abdut-Ramin ibn Ka"b, the brother of Band Mazin ibn An-Naij
“Amr ibn Humam ibnulJamoh, the brother of Band Salima; “Abdullah

transport you.” They turned away. their eyes overflowing with tears. grieved
that they did not find anything to expend for the expedition,

Someone told me (the author) that Ibn Yamin ibn ‘Umayr ibn Ka'b
an-Nadri saw Ab0 Layla and “Abdultih ibnul-Mughaffal while they were
weeping, When he asked them for the reason, they told him that they had
‘gone fo the Prophet (pbuh) to obtain a ride, but he had none to provide them
with and they could afford nothing. At once he provided them with a
watering camel which they saddled and he further supplied them with some
dates so they were able to leave with the Prophet (pbuh),

‘Some bedouins came with ready excuses that they might be permitted to
stay at home, but Allah did not accept their excuses. I heard that they were
from Band Ghifir. Then the Prophet (pbuh) became ready to travel, so he
decided to march out,

A band of Mustims, including Kab ibn Malik ibn Abi Kab; Mardrah
ibn Rabi’; Hilal ibn Umayyah; and Abo Khaythamah, hesitated in making
Uup their minds until they lagged behind. Nevertheless, they did so without
any doubt or misgivings, and they were truthful and no one accused them of
anything concerning their being Muslims.

‘The Prophet (pbuh) encamped by Thaniyyatul-Wada’."") “Abdullah ibn
Ubayy camped out separately below the Prophet's encampment toward
Dhubab.?) It was said that it was not the smaller of the (wo camps. While
the Prophet (pbuh) proceeded, “Abdullih ibn Ubayy withdrew and remained
behind with the hypocrites and those who doubted.

‘The Prophet (pbuh) ordered “Ali ibn Abi Talib to stay behind with his
family to look after them. The hypocrites spread out rumors that the Prophet
(pbuh) had left him beiind because of being a burden on the Prophet (pbuh)
who wanted to be rid of him. When he heard these words “Ali seized his
weapons and overtook the Prophet (pbuh) while stopping at ALJurf.<
When he repeated to him the hypocrites’ sayings, the Prophet (pbuh)
answered, "They lie. et you stay for what I hid left behind, so return and repre-
sent me in my family and yours. Would you not be pleased, O “Alt 10 hold wish me
the position that Hariin held with Masd, expect that there is no Prophet after me?”
Thus, “Ali retumed to Madinah and the Prophet (pbuh) continued in his
travel

On a hot day, Abd Khaythamah retuned to his family, days after the
Prophet (pbuh) had departed. His two wives were in their huts in his garden.
Each had made her hut coo! by sprinkling water and they had prepared food
for him, Standing at the door of the hut, he looked at his wives and what
they had prepared for him, and said, "The Prophet (pbuh) is out in the sun,
wind, and heat, while Abd Khaythamah is in a cool shade, food had been

prepared for him, resting in his property with a beautiful woman. This is not
fair, By Allah, I will not enter either of your huts, but I will join the Prophet
(pbuh), so prepare some provision for me.” They did so. He went to his
watering camel, saddled it, and directed to the direction of the Prophet
(pbuh) until he caught up with him and the army in Tabiik. Earlier on his
way, AbG Khaythamah met “Umayr ibn Wahb al-Jumahi who was also
searching for the Prophet (pbuh), so they accompanied each other until they
joined the troops. Approaching Tabak, Aba Khaythamah said to “Umayr, “I
have done a sin, so it is better that you stay behind me until | meet the
Prophet (pbuh),” and he did so. When he went closer to the Prophet (pbuh)
as he alighted in Tabdk, the army observed a rider coming towards them.
The Prophet (pbuh) said, "Be Abit Khaythamah", and the Muslims said that it
‘was he. He dismounted and greeted the Prophet (pbuh), who said, “You were
close to destruction, Aba Khaythamah!" After telling him what had happened,
the Prophet (pbuh) said good words to him and invoked Allah on his behalf.

The Prophet (pbuh) halted at Al-Hije””, where his men drew water the
well therein. The Prophet (pbuh) said to them, "Do not drink any of its water
nor use it for ablutions; forage to the camels whatever dough you have used its wa-
ter for making it, and do not eat any of i; and let no one of you go out tonight with
‘out a companion.” The men obeyed him, but two of Band Saidah went out
alone. One went out to relieve himself and collapsed in his place, while the
other was searching for his camel and a wind carried him away and cast him,
‘on the two mountains of Tayyi’. When the Prophet (pbuh) was told of this,
he said, “Did I not forbid you not to go out alone?" Then he prayed for the man
‘who collapsed and he recovered. As for the other who fell between the two
‘mountains of Tayi’, he was later brought back to the Prophet (pbuh) in
Madinah by the people of Tayyi'

In the moming when the men complained to the Prophet (pbuh) of
having no water, he supplicated Allah for help, and He sent a cloud that
poured so much rain that they were satisfied and carried the water they
needed, While traveling on their way, the camel of the Prophet (pbuh) was
Jost and his Companions went out to search for it. The Prophet (pbuh) had

with him one of his Companions, “Umirah ibn Hazm, who was present
during the Pledge of AL Agabah and and Battle of Badr, and he was also
the paternal uncle of Band “Amr ibn Hazm. He was sharing his ride with
Zayd iboul-Lusayt of Band Qaynugi’, who was a hypocrite. Being in
‘Umarah’s camp, Zayd said, when “Umrah was with the Prophet (pbuh),
“Does Muhammad claim that he is a Prophet and receives news from
heaven, when he does not know where his camel is?” At that moment the
Prophet (pbuh) said when “Umarah was with him, "A man says, ‘Muhammad
tells you that he is a Prophet and claims that he tells you news from heaven, when
he does not know where his camel is’. By Allah, 1 know onty what Allah has made
‘me know and Allah has guided me to its place. Iris in this valley in stch-and-such
‘a mountain pass. A tree has hold it back with its bridle: so go and bring tt to me.”
‘They went and brought it.

‘When he returned to his camp, “Umrah said, "By Allah, the Prophet
(pbuh) has just told us a wonderful thing about what was said by someone
which Allah had informed him." Then he repeated the story. One of those
who was in “Umirah’s camp and not with the Prophet (pbuh) exclaimed,
"By Allah, it is Zayd who had said this before you came in.” “Umérah
rushed to Zayd pricking him in the neck and saying, "Come on, servants of
‘Allah! I had in my camp a deceiver whom | knew nothing of. Get out, you
enemy of Allah, and do not accompany me.” Some people said that Zayd
later repented, while others claimed that he was accused of evil until he
died

“Then the Prophet (phubi) continued on his travel, whereas other men
began to linger behind. When the Prophet (pbuh) was told that so-and-so
had lingered he said, “Leave him alone; if there is good in him, Allah the Al-
mighty will make him join you, and if not, Allah has relieved you of him.”

AbGi Dharr had dropped behind because of his eamel, so he took the load
‘on his back and walked to catch up with the Prophet (pbuh). The Prophet
(pbuh) alighted at one of the stopping-places when a Muslim drew his
attention to a man walking on the road alone, The Prophet (pbuh) said, “He
Abit Dharr!" Looking carefully, the people said that it was he, The Prophet
(pbuh) said, "May Allah have mercy on Abii Dharr, He walks alone, will die
alone, and will be raised alone.”

According to “Abdullih ibn Mas‘Od, when Uthman exiled Abd Dhar
(when the former was a Caliph) to Ar-Rabidhah where he died, no one was
‘with him but his wife and his slave, He bequeathed them to wash him (after
death), put him in his shroud, lay him at the middle of the road, and say to
the first caravan, “This is Ab@ Dharr, the Prophet's (pbub) companion. so
help us bury him". On his death, they did so. “Abdullah ibn Mas'Gd came up
with a band of Iraqi men on a° Umrah, when they suddenly found the bier in
ir way. The camels were about to step on it. The slave went to them
. "This is AbG Dhatr. the Prophet's Companion. Help us bury him.”
“Abdullah ibn Mas‘fid wept and said, “The Prophet (pbuh) was right (as he
said that) you walk atone, die alone, and will be raised alone." Then he and
those who were with him dismounted and buried Aba Dhare. Afterwards
“Abdullah narrated (0 them his story and what the Prophet (pbuh) said about
hhim during the march to Tabak.

‘When the Prophet (pbuh) reached Tabak, Yubannd ibn Ru'bah the head
of Aylah came to him and a reconciliation was made and he paid him the
tribute. The people of Jarba’ and Adhnuh also did the same, The Prophet
(pbuh) wrote a letter of guarantee. He (pbuh) wrote to Yuhanna ibn Ru’bah,

“In the name of Allah, the All-Merciful, the Ever-Merciful. This is a
‘guarantee from Allah and Muhammad the Prophet, the Messenger of Al-
Jah, to Yuhanna ibn Ru’bah and the people of Aylah, for their ships and

Yemen, and the seamen, all have the protection of Allah and the pro-
tection of Muhammad the Prophet. Whosoever breaks this pledge, his

Khalid ibnul-Walid is Dispatched
to Ukaydir at Damah

‘The Prophet (pbuh) dispatched Khilid ibnul-Walid to Ukaydir at Damah.
Ukaydir ibn * Abdel-Malik of Kindah was the king of Dimah and he was a
Christian. The Prophet (pbuh) told Khalid that he would find him hunting
cows, Thus, Khalid set out until he was within sight of his fortress. It was
moonlit summer night when Ukaydir was with his wife on the roof. The

cows were rubbing their hors against the castle gate. His wife urged him to
{g0 afier the cows. He ordered that his horse be saddled then he went off
with a band of his family, among them was his brother Hassan. During their
ride, the cavalry of the Prophet (pbuh) attacked them, captured the king, and
killed his brother. Ukaydir was dressed in a brocade gown covered with
gold. Khilid took the gown away from him and sent it to the Prophet (pbuh)
before bringing him in person.

‘Anas ibn Malik said, "I saw the gown of Ukaydir when it was delivered
to the Prophet (pbuh). The Muslims kept on touching it with their hands and
wondering, but the Prophet (pbub) said, "Do you wonder at this? By Hion in
Whose Hand is my soul the napkins of Sa'd ibn Mu'dédh in Paradise are hetter than
this.” Thn Ishaq said that Khalid brought Ukaydir to the Prophet (pbuh) who
spared his life and reconciled him on condition that he pays the tribute.
‘Then he set him free and he returned to his town,

The Prophet (pbuh) spent more than ten nights in TabOk. Then he
retuned to Madinah. On the way back, there was water flowing from a rock
in the valley of Al-Mushagqag that could be used by only two or three
riders. The Prophet (pbuh) gave orders that whoever preceded there should
not take water from it until the others arrived. A number of hypocrites went
there first and used the water, When the Prophet (pbuh) arrived there he
found no water. He asked about who had done so and he was told about
their names. He said, "Did J nor prohibit them from drawing any (water) from it
nuit | arrived?” He cursed them and invoked Allah against them. Then he
dismounted and put his hand under the rock, and water began to flow into
his hand as Allah willed, Then he sprinkled the rock with the water and
rubbed it with his hand and supplicated Allah with the words He willed.
Then watet was ejected, as those who heard it said, making a sound like
thunder, The people drank and met their needs with it, and the Prophet
(pbuh) said, “Wf you survive, oF those of you who will survive, you will hear about
this valley when it will have made the (whole) area before and around it fertile.”

Ibn Ishiig said that Ibn Shihab a2-Zuhri reported from Ibn Ukaymah
al-Laythi from the nephew of Abd Ruhm al-Ghifiiri that he heard Aba
Ruhm Kulthim ibnul-Husayn, who was one of the Companions who swore
allegiance to the Prophet (pbuh) under the Tree, say, "On the journey of

near the Prophet (pbuh) we fell into deep sleep. 1 started to wake up when
‘my camel went closer to the Prophet's camel. 1 feared that if it went too
close to his foot he would be injured in the stirrup, I kept on drawing my

camel bumped against his until his foot was in the stirrup and I was roused
by his voice saying, J am pained’. I asked him to ask Allah to forgive me
and he ordered me to go on. The Prophet (pbuh) began to ask me about
those who had lagged behind from Band Ghifar and I told him. He
questioned me about the tall men with little hair on their beards and
eyebrows and | told him that they had lingered. Then he asked me about the
short black men whom at first I did not remember until he reminded me that
they owned camels in Shabakat Shadakh. ‘Thereupon | recalled that they

to me is that the Muhdjirin from the Quraysh. the Ansér, Ghifir, and Aslam stay

The Deputation of Thaqif Embraces Islam
in Ramadan of the year 9 AH

hn Ishq said that it was Ramadin when the Prophet (pbuh) returned
from TabOk. In that month the deputation of Thagif came to him, As the
Prophet (pbuh) turned away from them, “Urwah ibn Mas‘id ath-Thagafi
followed him until he overtook him before his artival in Matlinah, and
embraced Islam, He requested trom the Prophet (pbuh) that he might return
to his people with Islam, but, as his people said, he (pbuh) said to him, "They
will kill you", for the Prophet (pbuh) knew hew stubborn they were.
However, “Urwah said they cherished him more than their firstborn. Being
loved and obeyed, he went out and called his people to Islam, hoping that
they would not oppose him because of his position among them. He
ascended to a high room showing himself to them after inviting them to

Islam which he had declared as his religion. At once, they shot arrows at
him from all directions until he was killed.

Band Malik claimed that one of their men killed him, who was known as
‘Aws ibn “Awf, the brother of Band Salim ibn Malik, while Al-Ablaf alleged
that Wahb ibn Jabir of their men from Band “Attib ibn Malik killed him.
While breathing his last, "Urwah was asked, "What do you think of your
death?" He said, "It isan honor which Allah has bestowed on me and a
martyrdom which Allah has led me to, Tam like the martyrs who were slain
with the Prophet (pbub) before he left you, so bury me with them.” Thus he
‘was buried with them. It was said that the Prophet (pbuh) said that “Urwah
was among his people like the man of Yasin'”” among his people.

Some months after the killing of “Urwah, Thagif made deliberations
‘among themselves and concluded that they could not fight the Arabs all
‘arouind them, who had given fealty to the Muslims and embraced Islam, So
after consultation they decided to dispatch a man to the Prophet (pbuh),
They proposed this idea to “Abd Yalil ibn “Amr, one of “Urwab's peers. but
he refused, fearing that “Urwah’s story would be repeated. He made @
condition that he would not go unless accompanied by some men, Hence,
they agreed to send two men from Al-Ablaf and three from Band) Malik.
‘These six were: “Abd Yalil; Al-Hakam iba “Amr iba Wahb ibn ‘Mu’ atti
‘Shurahpil ibn Ghaylan ibn Salamah ibn Mu‘attib; and from Band) Malik,
Uthman ibn Abel-As ibn Bishr ibn “Abd Duhmin, the brother of Band
Yasdsr, and Aws ibn “Aw, the brother of Band Salim, and Numayr ibn
Kharashah ibn Rabi'ah, the brother of Band Al-Harith. “Abd Yalil led the
group, aS he accompanied them only to avoid what had been done to
“Urwah and so that each man on his return to ALTAif could secure the
attention of his clan.

Approaching Madinah, they stopped at Qanit where they met
‘AlMughirah ibn Shu'bah whose tun it was to graze the camels of the
Prophet's Companions, for the Companions took this task in tums. On
seeing them, he left the camels with the Thagifs, and ran at full speed to tell
the Prophet (pbuh) about their arrival, Aba Bakr met him before he could
center to the Prophet (pbuh). He informed him about the caravan of Thagif

who had come to pay homage and embrace Islam on the conditions of the
Prophet (pbuh) provided that they could get a letter guaranteeing their
People, land, and propery. Abd Bakr swore that Al-Mughirah should let
him tell the Prophet (pbuh) the news and he accepted. Thus AbG Bakr told
the Prophet (pbuh) while Al-Mughirah went back to the people of Thaqif
and brought the camels back, Although Al-Mughirah taught them how to
‘greet the Prophet (pbuh), they greeted him with the pre-Islamic salutation. It
‘was said that when they reached the Prophet (pbuh), a tent was pitched for
them near his Mosque. Khalid ibn Said ibnul-As acted as mediator
between them and the Prophet (pbuh) until they got their letter of guarantee,
It was actually he who wrote it. They ate no food which was brought to
them from the Prophet (pbuh) unless Khalid ate some. They remained in
this condition until they had embraced Islam and received their letter.

Among the things they asked the Prophet (pbuh) was that they stiould be
permitted to keep their idol, Al-Lat, and that it should not be demolished for
three years, The Prophet (pbuh) refused, and they continued imploring him
for two or even one year but he still refused, Finally they asked for a month
after their return; but he rejected to set any time. They tried to show that the
aim of their request was to be secured from their fanatics, women, and
children by leaving the idol, so as not to cause fear by demolishing it, until
they had embraced Islam, The Prophet (pbuh) insisted on his refusal and
sent Abi Sufyan ibn Harb and Al-Mughirah ibn Shu’bah to destroy it. They
further requested the Prophet (pbuh) to exempt them from prayers, and to
exempt them from breaking their idols with their own hands. The Prophet
(pbuh) accepted to exempt them from destroying their idols with their own
hands, but as for prayers. he said, “There is no goodness in a religion that has
no prayers.”

Once they had become Muslims, and had the letter of guarantee, the
Prophet (pbuh) appointed Uthmain ibn Abel-”As over them, in spite of his
young age. This was because Aba Bakr had told the Prophet (pbuh) that
Uthmin was the keenest among them to learn the teachings of Islam and the
Qur'an.

Having accomplished their task, the Thagif deputation retumed to their
land in the company of Abd) Sufyin ibn Harb and Al-Mughirah ibn Shu’bah
whom the Prophet (pbuh) sent with them to destroy the idol. When they

—Gp—



<br><br><br>

were near ALTAIf, AFMughirah asked Abi Sufyfn to advance him, but
‘Abd Sufyan refused, telling him to go to his people while he waited with his
property in Dhul-Hudum. Al-Mughirah went to the idol and started to striks
it with a pickaxe, while his people of Band Mu'atib stood defending him
from any attack, fearing that he would meet the fate of “Urwab, The Thagift
women came out with their faces uncovered bewailing the idol

“Alas for you, alas!” said AbO Sufyan, as Al-Mughirah was destroying
the idol with the axe. After Al-Mughirah demolished it, he collected the
jewelry, gold, beads, and things on it, and sent for Abd Sufyan.

‘Aba Mulayh ibn “Urwah and Qarib ibnul-Aswad went to the Prophet
(pbuh) after the killing ‘of “Urwah and before the Thagif deputation, aiming
to withdraw from Thagif and to forsake them completely. As they embraced
Islam, the Prophet (pbuh) told them to take as patrons whoever they wished
‘They answered that they chose Allah and His Messenger. The Prophet (pbuh)
said, "and your maternal uncle Aba Sufydn ihn Harb. ” and they accepted.

Consequently, after the people of AL-TS'if had embraced Islam and the
Prophet (pbuh) had sent Abo Sufyin and Al-Mughirah to destroy the idol,
Abd Mulayb ibn “Urwah asked the Prophet (pbuh) to fulfil his father's debt
from the property of the idol, When the Prophet (pbuh) agreed, Qérib
ibnul-Aswad demanded the same thing concerning his father's debt. “Urwah
und Al-Aswad were full brothers. “Al-Aswad died as a polytheist”, the Prophet
(pbuh) said. Qarib replied, "O Messenger of Allab, but you will be binding
toa Muslim of a near kin - meaning himself - and the debt is only obligatory
‘on me and it is required of me.” The Prophet (pbuh) ordered AbG Sufyan to
fulfil the debts of " Urwah and Al-Aswad from the possessions of the idol.

The text of the letter of guarantee of the Prophet (pbuh) which: was
written for them was as follows:

“In the name of Allah, the Most-Merciful anil the Ever-Merciful. From
Muhammad the Prophet, the Messenger of Allah, to the believers: The
trees of Wajj are not to be damaged. Anyone found doing anything of
this will be whipped and his clothes will be taken away, and if he trans-
_gresses this, he will be taken and Prophet Muhammad will be informed
‘about it, This is the command of Prophet Muhammad, the Messenger of

The Ninth Year, the Year of Deputations

According to Ibn Ishq, after the Prophet (pbuh) had taken control of
‘Makkah, and had returned from Tabak, and after ‘Thagif had embraced Islam
‘and sworn allegiance, Arab deputations flowed to him from all directions."

The Arab tribes were watching the relation between Islam and the Quraysh,
for they did not deny that the Qurayshis were chiefs and guides of men, the
people of the Inviolable Mosque, the pure progeny of Prophet Ismiil, the
son of Ibrittim, and the leaders of Arabs. In the first place, it was the
Quraysh who had waged war against the Prophet (pbuh) and opposed him.
After the Conquest of Makkah, the Quraysh surrendered to Islam and the
Prophet (pbuh), so the Arabs realized that they could not fight the Prophet
(pbuh) or show animosity towards him. Likewise, they entered into the
Religion of Allah ¢in crowds}, as Allah the Almighty said, going to. him
from all directions. Allah the Almighty said to His Prophet,

When comes the Help of Allah (to you, O Muhammad against your en-

‘emies) and the conquest (of Makkah), And you see that the people enter

Allah's religion (Islam) in crowds, So lorify the Praises of your Lord,

and ask for His Forgiveness. Verily, He is the One Who accepts the re-

pentance and forgives.»

(An-Nasr; 1-3)

Le. Thank Allah for His having made your religion triumphant, and ask His
forgiveness, for He is the One Who accepts the repentance and forgives.

The Arrival of the Deputation of Bana Tamim

Arab deputations came to meet the Prophet (pbuh). “Utirid ibn Hajib ibn
Zurarah ibn “Udus at-Tamimi came with others notables of Band Tamim

<br><br><br>

including Al-Agat ibn Habis, Az-Zibrigin ibn Badr of Band Sud, “Amr
ibnul-Ahtam, and Al-Habbab ibn Yazid. In the deputation of Band Tamim
were Nu‘aym ibn Yazid, Qays ibnul-Harith, and Qays ibn “Asim, the
‘brother of Band Sa'd, and there was with them “Uyaynah ibn Hisn ibn
‘Hudhayfah ibn Badr al-Fazasi,

‘Ab-Agra’ iba Habis and “Uyaynah ibn Hisn had witnessed with the
Prophet (pbuh), the Conquest of Makkah and the Battles of Hunayn and
‘A‘TSif. Entering the mosque, the deputation called out to the Prophet
(pbuh), who was behind in his apartments, "Come out t0 us, Muhammad!”
‘Their loud voices bothered the Prophet (pbuh). However, he went out to see
them, and they said, "O Muhammad, we have come to show you our glory,
so give permission to our poet and our orator to speak.” The Prophet (pbuh)
gave permission to their orator, so “Unirid ibn Hajib advanced and said,

All praise be to Allah Who has bestowed grace and bounty on us and
Who is worthy to be praised. It is He who made us kings, endowed us with
reat wealth wherewith we give charity, made us the strongest, greatest in
umber, and the best equipped of the people of the East, so who among
mankind is our equal? Are we not the heads and superiors of mankind? He
who would vie in glory with us should count out like what we have
‘enumerated. If we wished we could say more, but we are too bashful to say
much of what He has bestowed on us and are known for that. 1 say this that
you may bring forward the like and anything better.” Then he sat down.

“The Prophet (pbuh) said to Thabit iba Quys ibnesh-Shammis, the brother of
Band Al-Hérith ibnul-Khazraj, "Ger up (and deliver a speech) answering that of
this man". Thabit got up and said,

"All praise be to Allah Who created heaven and earth and established
His rule therein, and Who knows everything in them. Nothing has ever
existed but out of His bounty. By His power He made us rulers, selecting
the best of His creation as a Messenger, who is the most honorable in
lineage, most truthful in speech, and the best in reputation, So He sent down
to him His Book and entrusted him with it to mankind so he was Allah's
choice from the worlds. Then He called people to believe him, and so did
the Muhijirtin of his people and kinsmen; the most honorable in reputation,
the highest in dignity, and the best in deeds. We were the first to answer and
respond to Allah when the Messenger of Alluh called them, We have always

—e—



<br><br><br>

been helpers in the cause of Allah and ministers of His Messenger. We fight
People until they believe in Allah: so he who believes in Allah and His
Messenger (pbuh) has protected himself and his property from us, and he
who disbelieves, we fight him in the way of Allah forever, and killing him
will be an easy thing for us. I say these words and ask Allah's forgiveness
for me and for the believers both men and women. Peace be upon you.”

‘Then Az-Zibriqin ibn Bade stood and said some poetic verses in which
he showed the glories of his people. At this time, Hassin (ibn Thabit) was
‘ot present, so the Prophet (pbuh) sent for him to attend and answer the poet
of Band Tamim. Hassin went to the Prophet (pbuh) saying some verses

When Hassin arrived to the Prophet (pbuh) and the Tamimi poet had

The Story of “Amir ibnut-Tufayl and Arbad ibn
Qays from the Deputation of Bana “Amir

Among the deputation of Band “Amir were their three leaders and
devils, namely, “Amir ibnut-Tufayl, Arbad ibn Qays ibn Jaz’ ibn Khalid ibn
33 far, and Jabbar ibn Salma ibn Malik ibn Jafar

<Q



<br><br><br>

“Amir, the enemy of Allah, came to the Prophet (pbuh) with treachery in
his mind, His people advised him to embrace Islam like the others, but he
said, “I have vowed that T will not cease until the Arabs follow my heels:
‘Am [ to follow the heels of this fellow of the Quraysh?” Then he said to
‘Asbad, "When we go to him [will divert his attention away from you, so
that you can smite him with your sword,” When they arrived and met the
Prophet (pbuh) “Amir said, "O Muhammad, take me as a friend.” He
eplied, "No, by Alla, 1 will not until you believe in Allah alone.” Hee restated the
request and kept on speaking to him expecting that Arbad would do as they
had agreed but the latter stayed still, He again repeated his request and the
Prophet (pbuh) said, "No, by Allah, 1 will nat until you believe in Allah, alone
with no partner”, When the Prophet (pbuh) refused insistently, he said, "By
‘Allah, | will spread the land against you with cavalry and men.” After theit
departure, the Prophet (pbuh) supplicated to Allah the Almighty saying, "O
Allah, protect me from “Amir ibmut-Lufayl!”

On their return, “Amir said to Arbad, "Woe to you, Arbad, why did you
not do as T had commanded you? By Allah, there was no man on earth
whom I feared more than you, but by Allah, I shall never fear you after
today.” He answered, “Do not say that. Every time I came to do what you
had ordered me, you got in between us so that I could see only you. Was Ito
strike you with the sword?”

As they were going home. Allah sent a plague in > Amir’s neck, and he
lied in the house of a woman of Band Saldl, He used to say, “O Band “Amir,
‘boil ike the boil of a young camel in the house of a woman of Band Said!”

After burying him, his companions returned in winter to the land of
Band “Amir. The people questioned Arbad about what had happened.
"Nothing, by Allah,” he said, “he called us to worship someone and I wish
he were here now so that I could shoot him with arrows and kill him." After
a day or two had passed, he was out with his camel following him, when
Allah sent on him and his camel a thunderbolt which killed them. Arbad
was the brother of Labid ibn Rab'ah from the maternal side. Labid said an
eleginc poem for Arbad.

The Arrival of Al-Jarad
with the Deputation of “Abdul-Qays

Al-Jirad ibn “Amr iba Hanash, the brother of “Abdul-Qays,” came to
the Prophet (pbuh), Al-Hasan narrated that when AlJarid went to the
Prophet (pbuh) he talked to him and the Prophet (pbuh) explained Islam to
him and called him to embrace it using encouraging words, He replied, "O
Muhammad, | adhere to a religion, so if 1 abandon it for yours, will you
guarantee my (new) religion)?" The Prophet (pbuh) said, "Yes, 1 guarantee
‘hat Allah has guided you to-a better one (i.e: religion) than it”, Hence he and his
companions embraced Islam. When he asked the Prophet (pbuh) for some
transport, be told him that he had none available, Al-Sérid remarked that
there were lost beasts roaming between Madinah and his town and asked
whether they could take some of them to carry them to their land. The
Prophet (pbuh) warned him, "No, keep away fram them, for these are (i.e. they
cause) the flame of the Hell-fir

Al-Jiriid returned home and became a good Muslim and firm in his
religion until his death. He lived until the time of the Apostasy Wars. When
some of his people who had embraced Islam apostatized with Al-Ghartr
ibnul-Mundhir ibn an-Nu’man ibn al-Mundhir, al Jardd delivered a speech,
calling the people to Islam. He said, "O people, I witness that there is no
god but Allah and that Muhammad is His servant and messenger and 1
accuse of disbelief anyone who refuses to bear the same testimony.”

The Arrival of Bani Hanifah Accompanied by
Musaylimah the Liar

The deputation of Band Hanifah came to the Prophet (pbuh) and among
them was Musaylimah ibn Habib al-Hanafi, the Liar. They stayed in the
house of the daughter of Al-Harith, an Ansari woman of Band An-Najjar.
According to some scholars of Madinah, Band Hanifah brought him to the

Prophet (pbuh) while concealing him in clothing. The Prophet (pbuh) was
sitting among his Companions and there was a palm-branch bearing some
eaves. While be was covered with garments, he spoke to the Prophet (pbuh)
and asked him (for a gift). The Prophet (pbuh) answered, "If you were to ask
‘me for this palm branch, 1 would not give ito you.”

Tbn Ishaq said that an old man from Band Hanifah from the people of
‘Al-Yamamah told him that things went differently. He claimed that the
deputation went to the Prophet (pbuh) while Musaylimah was left behind
with the camels and the luggage. When they embraced Islam they
mentioned his place to the Prophet (pbuh) saying that he was left behind to
‘guard their possessions. The Prophet (pbuh) ordered that he should be
provided with the same as the others, saying, “His standing is not worse than
yours.” ive. in guarding the belongings of his companions, That is what the
Prophet (pbuh) meant, He said that they left the Prophet (pbuh) and. gave
him what he had sent for him. Once they arrived at Al-Yamimah,
‘Musaylimah apostatized, alleged that he was a prophet and acted as a liar.
He said, "Iam his partner in the matter (i.e. prophethood and the Mission),”
‘and turning to the deputation who were with him, he said, "Did he not say to
‘you when you mentioned me to him "His standing is not worse than yours”?
‘What can that mean but that he knows that I share with him in the matter’
Then he began to utter thymed prose trying to imitate the style of the
Qur'an, (Here is the meaning of what he said.) "Allah has been bountiful to
the pregnant woman; He has produced from her a living being that can
move; from her very midst. He made lawful for them khamr (any
intoxicant) and zind (adultery and fornication), and exempted them from
prayers.” Nevertheless, he testified that the Messenger of Allah (pbuh) was
a Prophet. Band Hanifah agreed with him on. that, But Allah knows what the
truth was.

The Affair of “Adiyy ibn Hatim

was told that “Adiyy ibn Hitim said, "No Arab detested the Prophet

of my camels, "Choose some of my well-trained, well-fed eamels, to be near
to me, and once you hear of Muhammad's army conquering this land just
give me @ note." One morning he came to me and said, "Whatever you
intended to do when Khalid’ cavalry approach you, do it now, for I have
‘seen flags and I asked about them and I was told that it was Muhammad's
army.” | ordered him to get me my camels and I made my family ride them

Some of the cavalry of the Prophet (pbuh) followed me sind took
captives from Tayyi’ among whom was Hétim’s daughter, who was brought
to the Prophet (pbuh). The Prophet (pbuh) knew about my Meeing to Syria.
‘When he passed by Hatim’s daughter, who was imprisoned with the captives
in an enclosure by the gate of the Mosque, she went to him, for she was a
‘courteous woman. She said, “O Messenger of Allah, my father is dead and
the one who should replace him has fled, so be bountiful to me, may Allab
be bountiful to you.” He asked her about the man who should look after her
and when she told him that it was “Adiyy ibn Hatim he said, "The one who
has escaped from Allah and His Messenger.” Then he went out. The next day
they exchanged the same words but on the day that followed, she lost hope.
A man behind him waved to her to talk to him. She repewted the same
words, asking him to be bountiful to her and he answered, “I have done so,
80 do not be hasty in leaving until you find a person of your people whom
you trust to take you home, and let me know.” She asked about the name of
the man who had motioned to her to talk and was told that it was “Alf ibn
Abi Talib. She remained there until a caravan arrived from Balyy or
‘Quah. All that she wished for was to join her brother in Syria. She went
to the Prophet (pbub) to inform him that she had found a reliable man of
feputation among her people. The Prophet (pbuh) provided her with
clothing and a mount and gave her expenses. Then she left with them until
she reached Syria.”

The Arrival of Farwah ibn Musayk al-Muradi

hn Ishaq said that Farwah ibn Musayk al-Muridi went to the Prophet
(pbuh), leaving the kings of Kindah. Just before the advent of Islam, a battle
called Ar-Radm had taken place between Murid and Hamddn in which
Murid lost many of its men, The leader of Hamdan in the battle was
Al-Ajda’ ibn Malik.” When Farwah came to the Prophet (pbuh), he asked
him, "O Farwah, are you distressed at what had happened to the people of Ar-
‘Radm2 He replied that such a defeat would upset any man, The Prophet
{pbub) said that this, in Islam, would bring his people good. Then the
Prophet (pbuh) appointed him over Murdd, Zubayd, and Madbhij and sent
with him Khalid ibn Sa’d ibn al-"Ag to collect alms. Khalid remained with
hhim until the death of the Prophet (pbuh).

The Arrival of “Amr ibn Ma‘d Yakrib
with a Group of Bana Zubayd

With some men of Band Zubayd, “Amr ibn Ma'd Yakrib went to the
Prophet (pbuh) and embraced Islam. Previously, he had said to Qays ibn
Makshdh al-Muridi when they heard of the Prophet (pbuh), “O Qays, you
are the head of your people. It has reached us that a man of the Quraysh
called Muhammad from the Hijaz claims to be a prophet, so take us to him
in order to find out the truth. If he is a prophet as he claims, you can know
and then we will follow him. In case he is not, then we will know.” Qays
declined his proposal and vilified his advice. Thereupon “Ame headed for
the Prophet (pbuh) and embraced Islam. When Qays heard this, he got angry
and menaced “Amr for going against him, rejecting his opinion. “Amr
answered that he first called him to a matter that is plainly right, ie. Islam.



<br><br><br>

~ Amr lived with his people of Band Zubayd when Farwah ibn Musayk
governed them, When the Prophet (pbuh) died, "Amr apostatized.

The Arrival of Al-Ash*ath ibn Qays with the
Deputation of Kindah

In Ishig said that according to Az-Zuhet ibn Shihab, AI-Ashath ibn
Qays went to the Prophet with eighty people from Kindah. He entered to
him (pbuh) in the mosque. They had combed their hair, blackened their eyes
with kohl, and were dressed in striped Yemeni garments edged with silk,
‘The Prophet (pbuh) asked them whether they had embraced Islam and when
they said that they had he asked, "So why is there stk about your necks?” They
tore it off and hurled it away.

‘Then AL-Ashvath ibn Qasys said, “O Messenger of Allah, we are the
children of the eater of bitter herbs and so are you." The Prophet (pbuh)
smiled and said that this related to Al~Abbiis ibn “Abdel-Muttalib and
Rabfah ibnul-Harith. They were merchants and whenever they moved
around among the Arabs and people asked them about their identity, they
used (0 say that they were children of the eater of bitter herbs, being proud
of that since Kindah were kings. Then he said to them, "Nay, we are the
children of An-Nadr ibn Kindnah: we do not follow our maternal lineage
denying our fathers.” Al-Ash’ath ibn Qays said, "Have you finished, O
people of Kindah? By Allah, if I hear a man say it again, T will give him
eighty strokes.”

The Arrival of Surad ibn *Abdillah al-Azdi

In a deputation from Al-Azd, Surad ibn “Abdilléh al-Azdi went to the
Prophet (pbuh), embraced Islam and became 2 good Muslim. The Prophet
(pbuh) appointed him over the Muslims of his people and commanded him
to fight the neighboring polytheists from the Yemeni tribes. To execute the
Prophet's command, Surad marched out and halted at Jurash, which was
then a closed city composed of mainly Yemeni tribes whom Kath’am had
joined seeking refuge in their Jand when they heard of the approach of the



<br><br><br>

‘Muslims. The Muslims besieged them for almost a month, withiout being
able to enter. Thus Surad retreated as far as a mountain known ax Shakr.
Yel, the citizens of Jurash thought that he had escaped from them in defeat,
so they went out in pursuit. When they caught up with him, he kept on
killing them in large numbers,

In another development, the people of Jurash had dispatched two of their
‘men to the Prophet (pbuh) in Madinah to find out what was taking place.
Being with the Prophet (pbuh) after the Zidir prayer. he asked them about
the location of Shake. The two men told him that in their country there was
‘mountain called Kashr - and so was it called by the people of Jurash - but he
‘assured that it was Shakr, and ot Kashr. “Then what is happening about it
now?" they asked. "Sacrifice camels of Allah are being slaughtered by it
now,” he said.

‘The two men sat with AbO Bakr or “Uthmin who said, "Woe to you!
‘The Prophet (pbuh) has just announced to you the defeat of your people, so
get up and ask him to pray to Allah to save them." They did so, and he
(pbuh) invoked Allah to save them. Afterwards, they went home and found
that their people were beaten on the day that Surad attacked them which was
on the very day and at the very hour at which the Prophet (pbuh) said those
words.

‘A deputation from Jurash went to the Prophet (pbuh) and embraced
{stam. He made for them a special sanctuary around their town with definite
‘marks for their horses. riding camels, and plowing cows. He ordained that it
was not lawful for other people to use it,

The Arrival of the Messenger of the Kings of
Himyar with a Letter

After the invasion of Tabik, a messenger came with a letter from the
kings of Himyar announcing their conversion (o Islam. These kings were:
‘AL-Harith ibn “Abd Kull, Nu°aym ibn “Abd Kula, and An-Nu'man of Dho
Ru'ayn, Ma’fir, and Hamdan,

Zur ah Dhd Yazan dispatched Malik bn Murrah ar-Rahawi to tell him

The Advice of the Prophet (pbuh) to Mu’ adh when

Sending him To Yemen

Ibn Ishiig said that “Abdullah ibn Abi Bakr told him that he was told that

when the Prophet (pbuh) sent Mu'adh (to Yemen) he gave him advice and
instructions saying, "Deat (with people) with ease, and not with difficulty; be of
‘good heart (with people) and do not dishearten (them). You are going to a people
from among the People of the Book who would ask you 'What is the key of heaven?"

Band Al-Harith ibn Ka*b Embrace Islam by the
Hands of Khalid ibnul-Walid

‘The Messenger of Allah (pbuh) sent Khélid ibnul-Walid in the month of

Rabr'ul-Akhir or Juméda al-Cla, 10 AH to Band Al-Harith ibn Ka’b in

Najrin. He ordered him to call them to Islam three days prior to any
fighting. In the case that they became Muslims, he should accept it from
them, while if they refused, he should fight them.

Khilid marched out to them, diffusing convoys in every direction to call
the people to Islam, saying, "O people, embrace Islam and you will be safe.”
So people accepted Islam, According to the orders of the Prophet (pbub)
case they embraced Islam and did not fight, Khalid stayed with them to
teach them Islamic teachings, the Book of Allah, and the Sunnah of His
Prophet (pbuh).

‘Then Khalid wrote to the Prophet (pbuh):

“In the name of Allah, the Most-Merciful, the Ever-Merciful. (This is a
etter) to Muhammad the Prophet and the Messenger of Allah (pbuh), from
Khalid ibnul-Walld, Peace be upon you, O Messenger of Allah, and Allah's
mercy and blessings, Praise be to Allah but Whom there is no god. O
Messenger of Allah (pbuh), you sent me to Band Al-Harith ibn Ka'b.
commanding me on reaching them not to fight them for three days, to call
them (o Islam, and to remain with them if they embrace it, and to accept it
from them and teach them the teachings of Islam, the Book of Alla, and the
Sunnah of His Prophet; and in case they do not submit, I should fight them.
T went to them, invited them to Islam for three days as ordained by the
‘Messenger of Allah (pbuh), and I sent convoys among them saying, ‘O Band
Al-Harith, embrace Islam and you will be safe’. They accepted it without
fighting and | remained among them commanding and forbidding them

the Islamic teachings and the Sunnah of the Prophet (pbuh). And, peace be

(10 the Right Path). So promise them (the good consequence of their
work) and warn them (against the evil of disobedience and the like), and
‘come with a deputation from them. And, peace and Allah's mercy and
blessing be upon you,”

Thus Khalid arrived to the Prophet (pbuh) with the deputation of Band
Al-Harith, among whom were: Qays ibnul-Husayn Dhul-Ghussah, Yazid
‘ibn Abdel-Madin, Yazid ibnul-Mubajjal, “Abdullah ibn Qurid az-Ziyadi,
Shaddad ibn“ Abdillah al-Qandini, and “Ame ibn“ Abdillah a-Dibab.

On seeing them coming, the Prophet (pbuh) asked, "Who are these people
who look like the men of India?” Someone answered that they were Band
Al-Hirith ibn Ka’b, After greeting the Prophet (pbuh), they said, "We bear
witness that you are the Messenger of Allah and that there is no god but
Allah." He also said, "And J bear witness that there is no god but Allah and that 1
‘am the Messenger of Allah.” Then he (pbuh) added, “Are you the people who
advance if they are driven away?” None of them answered. He repeated the
Question three times and none answered. When be said it for the fourth time
Yazid ibn “Abdel-Madiin said that they were those people and repeated his
answer four times, The Prophet (pbuh) said, "if Khalid had not written to me
that you had embraced Islam without fighting, I would have thrown your heads be
neath your feet.” Yazid replied, "But, by Allah, we do not praise you nor
Khalid." "Ther whom do you praise?” he asked, He said, "We praise Allah
‘Who has guided us with you, © Messenger of Allah.” “You are right” he
(pbuh) said. Then he asked, "How did you ever defeat those who fought yaw in
the pre-Islamic period?” "We never defeated anyone,” was their answer. "Nay,
‘but you used to vanquish those who fought you." he said. They replied, “O
Messenger of Allah, we used to vanquish those who fought us because we
‘were to come together and never disunited, and nor were we the fist to do
injustice.” He said, “You are right.”

‘The Prophet (pbuh) appointed Qays ibnul-Husayn over them. The
deputation went home at the end of Shawwal or at the beginning of
Dhul-Qa’dah. Only four months had passed after their return, when the

Zilimiin (polstheists and wrong-sdoers, etc.)*” He should give people
‘the good tidings of Paradise and the way to enter it, and warn them of
helt and the way to it, He should get familiarized with people so that
they may tnderstand religion. He should seach them the rites, voluntary
‘acts, and obligations of pilgrimage, and what Allak has commanded
(conceming it), both the greater pilgrimage and the lesser pilgrimage
which is Umrah, He should prohibit people from performing prayers in
‘one small piece of clothing unless its edges are folded over the shoulders,
{from squatting in, one dress which exposes their private parts to open
air, and from braiding the hair of their heads at the backs of the necks.

In the case that a dispute occurs between men, he should forbid them 10
resort to tribes and families, and let them appeal to Allah, alone with no
associate. Those who do not appeal to Allah but rather to tribes and
families should be struck with the sword until their appeal is to Allah,
‘alone with no associate.

He should command men t0 perform ablutions well, by washing their
‘faces, their hands to the elbows. and their feet to the ankles, and by rub-
‘bing (by passing wet hands over) their heads, as Allah hus ordered. He
should command them to abserve prayers at their designated times with

According to Ibn Ishaq, during the era of the Prophet (pbuh), two
arch-lairs appeared, namely, Musaylimah iba Habib in Yamamah among

<br><br><br>

Band Hanifah, and Al-Aswad ibn Ka’b al“Ansi in San’a. Abd Sa'id
al-Khudrt reported that he heard the Messenger of Allah (pbuh) while
delivering a speech from his pulpit, saying, "“O people, 1 saw the night of Al-
Qodr and then I was made to forget it. 1 saw on my arms two bracelets of gold
which I hated so 1 blew them and they flew away, I interpreted them to refer to
these two arch-liars, the one from Yemen and the one from Al-Yamdmak."

It is narrated that Abd Hurayrah said he heard the Messenger of Allah
(pbuh) saying, "The Hour will not come before thirty impostors emerge: each will
claim prophethood.”

Sending Zakah-collectors

‘The Prophet (pbuh) spread out his representatives to the lands of Islam
© collect Zakah. He dispatched Al-Muhdjir ibn Abi Umayyah to San‘a’,
‘rere AL"Anst rose against him while being there. Ziyd ibn Labid, the
brother of Band Bayddah al-Ansiri, was sent to Hadramawt. ~Adiyy ibn
“Hitim was put in charge of the aims of Tayyi’ and Bundi Asad. Malik ibm
‘Nuwayrah was to collect alms from Band Hanzalah. The collection of alms
from Band Sa’d was divided between two men from them, namely, Zibriqan
ibn Badr in one area and Qays ibn “Asim on gnother. AIAG ibn
al-Hadram? was sent to Bahrain, while “Alt ibn Abi Talib was sent to the
people of Najran, to collect both Zakdh and jizyah.

The Letter of Musaylimah
and the Prophet's Answer

Musaylimah iba Habib wrote to the Prophet (pbuh):

“(This is a letter) from Musaylimah, the Messenger of Allah, to
Muhammad, the Messenger of Allah, Peace be upon you. I have been made
to associate with you in the matter (ie. prophethood and the Mission). To us
belongs half the land and to the Quraysh the other half, but the Quraysh are
aggressors.” Two messengers carried this leter to him (pbuh).

<br><br><br>

hn Ishaq said that an old man from Ashja’ told him from Salamah ibn
Nu’aym ibn Mas’Gd al-Ashja'i from his father Nu'aym, that the latter heard
the Messenger of Allah (pbuh) saying to them (the two messengers) when
he read the letter, "You nvo, what do you think aboue it?” They replied that they
thought the same as Musaylimah, He (pbuh) said, “By Allah, were it not that
messengers are not to be slain, 1 would have cut off the heads of you both!” Then
he wrote to Musaylimah:

“In the name of Allah, the Mast-Merciful the Ever-Merciful. (This is a
{etter} from Muhammad, the Messenger of Allah, to Musaytimah the liar.
Peace be upon him who follows the guidance. Verily, the earth is Al-
ahs. He gives it as a heritage to whom He will of His slaves, and the
(blessed) end is for those who are conscious (of Allah).”

‘This took place at the end of the tenth year AH.
The Farewell Pilgrimage

At the beginning of Dhul-Qa'dah the Prophet (pbuh) began to prepare
for the pilgrimage and ordered the people to also prepare for it. It was the
‘twenty-fifth of Dhul-Qa°dah when the Prophet (pbuh) went out to perform
pilgrimage.) He performed pilgrimage, teaching the people its rituals and
instructions. He delivered a speech in which he clarified many important
matters. After praising and exalting Alla, he said,

“O. people! Listen to my words, for | do not know whether 1 will ever
meet you in this place after this year. O peopte! Surely, your blood and
property are inviolable until you meet Your Lord, as the inviolablity of
this day and this month. You will surely meet your Lord Who will ask
you about your deeds. I have proclaimed to you (the Message). He who
has a trust, let him restore it to him who has entrusted him with it. All
kinds of riba are nullified. and onty you have a right to your capitals,
without being unjust or others being unjust to you. Allah has decreed
that there is no riba, and surely the entire rib of Al-"Abbis ibn “Abdel-
Mutalib is abolished. Every right pertaining to bloodshed in the period
of ignorance (pre-Islam) is abolished and the first such right 1 abolish is

but he is pleased as long as he can be obeyed in anything other than

‘among your deeds. So beware of him (lest he corrupt your belief in) your
religion. O people! The potponing (of a Sacred Month) is indeed an ad-
dition to disbelief: thereby the disbelievers are led astray, for they make
it lawful one year and forbid it another year in order to adjust the nun-
ber of monahs forbidden by Allah, and make such forbidden ones lawful
and forbid what Allak has made lavful. Time has reached its full cycle
as it did on the day when Allah created the heavens and the earth. Veri-
hy, the number of months with Allah is twelve months (in a year); of them
four are Sacred, of which three are successive and Rajab of Mudar™,

It was said that the people said, “O Allah, yes.” Then the Prophet (pbuh)
said, "O Allah, bear witness.”

Usamah ibn Zayd Is Sent to Palestine

The Prophet (pbuh) Sends Envoys to the Kings

ba Hisham said that the Prophet (pbuh) sent some of his Companions as
envoys with letters to the kings calling them to Islam, Ibn Hisham also said
that Abd Bakr al-Hudhali said, "I heard that the Prophet (pbuh) went out
‘one day after the "Umrah which he had been refrained from performing on
the Day of Al-Hudaybiyah, and said ‘0 people, Allah has surely sent me as a
‘mercy to the whole (of mankind), so do not differ among yourselves about me as
did the disciples of ‘Isa ibn Maryam about him.’ The Companions asked, ‘How
‘was the disciples’ difference, 0 Messenger of Allah” He (pbuh) answered,
‘He invited them to that which I have invited you to. Those who were sent on a near
mission were pleased. while those who were sent on a far mission were displeased
and showed hesitation. “Isa complained to Allah, so every one of those who had
shown hesitation woke up the next moming speaking the language of the people 10
whom they were sent,”

The Prophet (pbuh) sent the following envoys with letters to the
following kings, calling them to Islam:

‘According to Ibn Ishq, Yazid ibn Abj Habib al-Misri said that he found
a document mentioning those who were sent by the Prophet (pbuh) to the
‘Arab and non-Arab countries and kings, as well as what he said to his
‘Companions on sending them. I showed it to Muhammad ibn Shihib
az-Zuhti who recognized it. It contained a version that the Prophet (pbuh)
addressed his companions saying, “Allah has surely sent me as a mercy to the
whole (of mankind), so represent me (in Da'wah) in order to get Allah's mercy and
do not differ among yourselves about me as did the disciples of “Isa ibn Maryam
about him.” The Companions asked, "How was the disciples’ difference, 0
Messenger of Allah?” He (pbuh) answered, ‘He invited them to that which 1
have invited you to. Those who were assigned (for a mission) to a near distance
were content and accepted, while thase who were assigned te a far distance dis-
liked it and refused. ‘Isi complained about them to Allah, so they woke up the next
‘morning speaking the language of the people to whom they were sent.”

Ibn Ishiiq said that the disciples and those who followed them whom “Isa
ibn Maryam sent through the land were as follows

The Beginning of the Prophet's Last Illness

Ibn Ishq said that under such circumstances, the Prophet (pbuh) began
to feel ill, and it was that illness with which Allah took him to what He had
decreed for him of honor and mercy. It was in late Safar or in early
Rabi'ul-Awwal. His illness started when he was went out to Bagi
al-Gharqad', in the middle of the night, where he asked Allah's forgiveness.
for the Muslim dead, then he went home. His ailment began in the morning.

‘Aba Muwayhibah, a mawld of the Prophet (pbuh), said, “In the middle
of the night the Prophet (pbuh) summoned me and said, ‘0 Abii Muwayhiba,
Thave received an order to ask forgiveness for the dead in Al-Bagt’, so come with
‘me.’ Thus, 1 went with him until he stood amidst them saying, ‘Peace be upon
‘you, O residents of the graves. Content are you with your condition thar people
here, as fan are coming like the waves of the dusky night. the last following the
{first, and the last is worse than the first.”"Then le looked at me and said, ‘O Aba
‘Muwayhibak, P was given the keys ofthe treasures of the world and perpetuation in
it, then Paradise, and I was made to. choose between that and meeting my Lord
and Paradise.’ U suggested, Take the keys of the teasures of the world and
perpetuation in it, then Paradise’, but he said, ‘No, by Allah, O Abi Mu-
wayhibah, 1 have chosen the meeting of my Lord and Paradise’. He asked
forgiveness for the dead in Al-Bag@” and lefl. Then he started to suffer from
the illness through which Allah eventually took him.

*A’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said, "Returning from the
graveyard, the Prophet (pbuh) found me suffering from a severe headache
and I was saying, 'O my head! He said, 1 is me. by Allah, O “Alishuh, (who
says.) O my head!’ Then he said, ‘What would grieve you if you die before nie so
that I may shroud you, offer prayer for you, and bury you?" 1 said, It seems to me
that having done that you would return to my house to spend a bridal night
with one of your wives.’ The Prophet (pbuh) smiled. His pain worsened as
he was passing by his wives, until he was beset in the house of Mayminah.

of the family of Sa°id ibmul-Mu'alla told him that the Prophet (pbub) said in
hhis speech on that day. "If / were to choose a close friend from among the ser
vants (of Allah), 1 would choose Aba Bakr, bur it is companionship and broth-
erhowrd in belief, until Allah gathers us together with Him.”

‘Also, Muhammad ibn Jafar ibn az-Zubayr told Az-Zubri that “Urwah
ihmuz-Zubayr and other scholars told him that the Prophet (pbuh) found that
the people had slackened in joining the mission of Usimah ibn Zayd white
te (pbuh) was suffering, so he went out with his head bound up until he sat
‘on the pulpit. The people had denounced the lealership of Usimah, saying.
“He (the Prophet) has assigned a junior in command of the Muhijirin and
the Angir.” So after praising and exalting Allah as is His due, the Prophet
(pbuh) said, "O people, fulfill (what you have been asked for concerning)
Usdmah's expedition, for t swear that though you denounce his leadership as you
did to the leadership of his father before him, he is efficient for leadership just as
his father was.”

“Then he (pbuh) descended while people rushed to their preparations. The
Prophet (pbuh's pain grew worse. as Usimah and his army set forth until
they reached Al-Jurf, ten or twelve arms (a farsakh) from Madinah, where
they pitched their camps. When the Prophet (pbuh) became seriously ill
Usimah and the troops waited there to sec what Allah would decree for the
Prophet (pbuh).

‘Av-Zuhei said that “Abdullah ibn Ka'b ibn Malik told him that the
Prophet (phuh) said on that day when he asked Allah's forgiveness for the
people of Ubud, "0 Muhdjirin, treat the Ansar well, for peop increase white
the Ansar remain as they are without increase. They were my privacy and shelter
tw which Lresorted. So do xood 10 those who do good among and forgive those of
them sho commit mistukex.” Then he alighted ‘and entered his house when his
pain increased until he fainted. Some of his wives came together to him,
among them were Umm Salamah and Mayminah, and some wives of the
Muslims, among them was Asmé, the daughter of ‘Umays. They all came
when his uncle “Abbas was with him. They agreed to give him medicine.
|AL*Abbis sid, “Let me do it for him." He did it. When the Prophet (pbuh)
woke up he asked who ha treated him thus. When they told hit that it was
his uncle he said, “This is « medicine which some women have brought from that

land - and he pointed to the direction of Abyssinia - so why have you dane
this?” His uncle said, “O Messenger of Allah, we feared that you would get
Dleurisy.” He answered, “Phat isa disease which Allah Would not make me suffer
fram. Let every one in the house take this medicine except my uncle.” Maymdnah
was made to take it although she was fasting because of the Prophet's order

‘This was a punishment for what they had done to him.

Usimah ibn Zayd reported, "When the illness of the Prophet (pbuh)
became severe, I and the men returned to. Madinah, Then I went to the
Prophet (pbuh) who was silent; unable to speak. He started raising his hands
to the sky and then bringing it down upon him, so 1 knew that he was
supplicating Allah for him.”

*Aiishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said, “For many times I heard
the Prophet (pbuh) saying, ‘Surely Allah never takes the seul of a Prophet with:
‘our making him choose.’ At the point of death, the last words 1 heard him
saying was, ‘Nay, rather the Higher Companion of Paradise’ | said (to myself),
‘Then, by Allah, he has not chosen us!” And I knew (the meaning of) that
th he repeated to us, namely, that a Prophet does not die without being
made to choose."

Aba Bakr Leads the People in Prayers

Az-Zuhri said that Hamzah ibn “Abdillah ibn “Umar told him that
*Aiishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said, "When the Prophet was
seriously ill, he said, "Order Aba Bakr to lead the people in prayers’. I said,
‘O Prophet of Allah, Aba Bakr is a delicate man with a weak voice, and he
(always) weeps when he recites the Qur'an'" ‘Order him 10 lead the people in
prayers,’ he repeated und | repeated my words as well. 1 wanted Abd Bake 10
be spared this task, because I knew that the people would never like a man
to replace the Prophet (pbuh), and it would have a bad amen for every
‘misfortune that might happen.”

“Abdullah ibn Zam'ah ibn al-Aswad ibn al-Muttalib ibn Asad said, "As
the Prophet (pbuh) became seriously ill, 1 was visiting him with some
Muslims when Bilal called him to prayer. He said, ‘Onder someone to leail the
people in the prayer’ Thus, 1 went out and found “Umar with the people,

while Aba Bakr was not there. [told “Umar to get up and lead them in the
prayer, and he did. When be said Allaiue Akbar, the Prophet (pbuh) heard iis
voice, for he had a sonorous voice, and asked, ‘Where is Abii Bakr? Allah and
the Muslims refuse that. Allah and the Mustims refuse that!’ So Abi Bakr was
‘summoned and he came after “Umar had finished that prayer and led the
people in prayer.”

“Abdullah ibn Zam‘ah said, "Umar said to me, ‘Confound you, what
have you done to me, son of Zam*ah? By Allah, when you asked me to do
so, I thought that the Prophet (pbuh) had commanded so, and had it not been
so, T would not have led people in the prayer, 1 replied, ‘By Allah, he did
not order mie to do so, but when I did not find AbO Bukr (I asked you to do
‘so because) | thought that you were the most rightful among the attendees to
lead people in the prayer.”

Tn Ishq said that Az-Zubri told him that Anas ibn Malik said, "When it
‘was Monday on which Allih took His Messenger (pbuh), he went out to the
people while performing the moming prayer. The curtain was raised. the
door was opened, and the Prophet (pbuh) came out and stood at “A'ishal’s
door. The Muslims were almost enraptured in their prayers for being
delighted with his presence, and be beckoned to them (0 continue their
prayers. The Prophet (pbuh) cheerfully smiled when he found them aligned
properly in prayer, and I never saw him in such a condition as he was in on
that day, Then he returned, whereas the people tuned away thinking that the
Prophet (pbuh) had recovered from his illness. Ab Bakr went out to his
wife in As-Sunb!"”

Ibn Ishi also said that Muhammad ibn Ibrahim ibn al-Harith told him
that ALQasim ibn Muhammad said, "When the Prophet (pbuh) heard "Urnar
saying Allalu Akbar in the prayer, he asked, ‘Where is Abi Bakr! Allah and the
Muslims refuse that! Had it not been that “Umar said a statement on his
death, the Muslims would not have doubted that the Prophet (pbuh) had
assigned Abd Bakr to succeed him, “Umar said when he was dying. If 1
appoint a successor, one who is better than me did so {meaning Ab0 Bakr):
and if | leave them (without doing so) one who is better than me did so
(meaning the Prophet (pbuh)).’ Therefore, the people knew that the Prophet

{pbuh) had not designated a successor and “Umut was not suspected of
‘being against Abd Bakr.”

Also, according to Thn Ishaq, AbG Bakr ibn” Abdlliah ibn Abi Mulaykah
told him that when the Monday (on which the Prophet died) came, the
Prophet (pbuh) went out to perform the morning prayer with his head
banded while Aba Bukr was leading the people in the prayer. When the
Prophet (pbuh) appeared, the people's attention was disrupted, Realizing
that the people would not behave like that unless the Prophet (pbuh) had
come. Abd Bakr withdrew from his place to give way to the Prophet (pbuh)
to Tead them in the prayer but he (pbuh) brought him back to his pl

saying, “Lead the people in prayer." The Prophet (pbuh) sat on the right side
of Abo Bakr performing the prayer in a sitting position. Having ended the
Prayer, he addressed the people with such a loud voice that could be heard
outside the mosque, "O peuple! The Fire is blazed, and fitan) are coming like
the waves of the duxky night! By Allah, you can lay nothing to my charge. 1 have
surely made lawful only what the Que‘an has made lawful and have prohibited only
what the Qur'an has proibite

The narrator continued, “When he finished his speech, Ab Bakr said to
him, “O Prophet of Allah, I see that you are becoming better out of the gras
and bounty of Alli as we wish for. Today is the day of the daughter of
Khirjah.'? Can 1 go to her?" The Prophet (pbuh) gave him permission to go
and Aba Bakr went to As-Sunh where she was.”

“Abdullib ibn “Abbas said that on the same day “Alf ibn Abi Talib went
out to the people after being with the Prophet (pbuh), so they asked him
how the Prophet (pbuh) was doing, "Thanks to Allah, He has recovered,” he
replied. Al“ Abbas took him by the hand saying, "O *Ali, I swear by Allah
that [can tell itis death in the Propher’s face, as I used to see it in the faces
of the sons of “Abdul-Muttalib, So let us go to the Prophet (pbuh), In ¢:

others we will ask him to enjoin the people to treat us well,” “Ali said, "By
Allah, I will not do so. If itis refrained from us, none after him will give it
to us." The Prophet (pbuih) died when the noon heat of that day increased.

shah (may Allah be pleased with het) said, "The Prophet (pbuh)
returned from the mosque that day and laid (placing his head) in my lap. A
man of Abd Bakr's household visited me with a green tooth-stick (siwak) in
his hand. The Prophet (pbuh) looked at it in such a way that 1 knew he
wanted it, so when I asked him if he would like me to give it to him he
agreed. Thus I took it to chew it for him to soften it and gave it to him, He
brushed his teeth with it more vigorously than 1 had ever seen him brushing
before. Then he put it down and f found him getting heavier in my lap.
When I Jooked into his face, his eyes had become fixed as he was
murmuring, ‘Nay, rather the Higher Companion of Paradise’ 1 said, "You have
been given the choice and you have chosen, by Him Who sent you with the
Trutht

Then the Prophet (pbulh) died. Thn Ishig said that Yahya ihn “Abadd ibn
“Abdillah ibn az-Zubayr told him that his father told him that he heard
“ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) saying, “The Prophet (pbuh) died
‘on my chest during my turn. I Was not unjust (o anyone in regard to him. It
was because of my foolishness and young age that when the Prophet (pbuh)
died, I laid his head on a pillow and got up beating my breast with the other
women and slapping my face.”

Abd Hurayrah said that on the death of the Prophet (pbuh), “Umar
addressed the people saying, "Some hypocrites claim that the Prophet
(pbuh) is dead. but by Allah he is not dead: he has gone 10 his Lord as
(Prophet) Masi ibn “Imran went. He (the latter) stayed away from his
people for forty nights and retumed to ther after it was said that he had
died. By Allah, the Prophet (pbuh) will surely come back as did Masa and
will cut off the hands and feet of those who claimed that the Messenger of
Allah (pbuh) is dead.”

When the news reached Abii Bakr, he went to the gate of the mosque
while “Umar was speaking to the people. He could think of nothing but
going to the Prophet (pbuh) who was lying covered by a mantle of Yemeni
cloth in "A'ishah’s house. He uncovered his face and kissed him saying, “I
ransom you with my father and mother. This is the death which Allah
‘ordained; you have tasted it, and you will never taste death again.” He then
covered the Prophet's face with the mantle again and left. As “Umar was still
speaking, he told him, “Genth imar. Listen,” but “Umar refused and kept

on talking. When Aba Bakr saw that he would not hearken he advanced to
the people who, hearing his words, went (0 him, leaving “Umar. After
thanking and praising Allah, he said, "O people! Whoever worships
Muhatnmad, (should know that) Muhammad is dead, while whoever
worships Allah, (showld remember that) Allah is Ever living: never dies,”
Then he recited the verse,

¢ Muhammad is no more than a Messenger, and indeed (many) Mes-
Sengers have passed away before him. If he dies or ix killed. will you
then turn back on your heels (as disbelievers)? And he who tums back
on his heels, not the least harm will he do to Allah, and Allah will give
‘reward to those who are gratefl. >
(Al Imran: 144)
‘The narrator said that on heating this verse, it seemed that the people
had never known that it had ever been revealed before Ab0 Bakr recited it
oon that day. Having heard it from him, the people went on repeating it. Abi
Hurayrah said that “Umar said, "By Allah, having heard it the verse) from
AbG Bakr, I was dumbfounded so that my legs would not carry me, so T fell
{0 the ground, and I realized that the Messenger of Allah (pbuh) had indeed
dead.”

The Affair of the Shed of Bana Sa*idah

When the Prophet (pbuh) died, the Anstri clan of Band Si*idah
ssembled around Sa’d ibn “Ubadah in the shed of Bani Sa’idah. “Ali ‘ibn
‘lib. Az-Zubayr ibnul--Awwim and Talhah ibn “Ubaydillah secluded
themselves in the house of Fitimah, whereas the other Muhdjirdn, joined by
Usayd ibn Hudayr with the Band “Abdul-Ashhual sided with Aba Bakr.
Somebody went to Abi Bakr and “Umar and said to them, “This clan of the
Ansar are gathering with Sa'd ibn “Ubidah in the shed of Band Si*idah and
they side with bim. If you are keen to have authority on the people's affairs,
then goto stop them before things become serious.” At this time, the
Prophet (pbuh) was still unburied in his house, where his family had locked
the door of the house, “Umar said, "T said to Abd Bakr, ‘Let us go to our

“Abdullah ibn “Abbas said that he was waiting for “Abdur-Rabman ibn
“AwE in his bouse at Mind while he was with “Umar in the last pilgrimage
which “Umar performed. He used to teach him reading the Qur'an. On his
return, he found “Abdullah waiting. “Abdur-Rabmin said to him, “I wish
you could have seen a man who came to the Commander of the Believers
‘and said, ‘O Commander of the Believers, would you do think of so and so
‘who said, ‘By Allah, if Umar were dead, T would swear allegiance to so and
so. By Allah, the fealty given to Ab0 Bakr was only a hasty slip which was
rotified’ "Umar was enraged and said, ‘If Allah wills. 1 shall deliver @
speech tonight and warn the people against those who want to usurp power.
I said to him, ‘Do not do it, O Commander of the Believers, for the
pilgrimage season brings together the rabbles and the vulgar people; they
will be the majority near to you. 1 fear that when you get up and say what
‘you want, that they will misinterpret it, so wait until you are in Madinah,
for it is the abode of the Sunnah and you can confer privately with the
intellectuals and the notables of the people. You can then say whatever you
want, for the intellectuals will grasp what you will say and interpret it
correctly.’ “Umar answered, ‘By Allah, if He wills, this will be the first thing
Ido when Larrive in Madinah’ "

Ibn “Abbas contiued, that they came to Madinah at the end of
Dhul-Hijjah. It was Friday when he (Ibn “Abbas) returned rapidly after the
stn had set. Finding $id ibn Zayd ibn “Amer ibn Nufayl sitting by a pillar
of the pulpit, he sat beside him, knee to knee. Instantly, “Umar appeared,
‘and when he saw him approaching, he said to Sa’id, "Tonight he is going to
say something on this pulpit which he has never said since he was given
rule.” Sa°id asked with denial, “What do you think he is going to say that he
has never said before?” “Umar was sitting on the pulpit, so when the
mu'adhdhin finished, he praised Allah as He is due and said,

“Today 1 am going to tell you something which is decreed to me to say

Moning in the Book of Allah is a true penalty for the midkgan people,

immoderately, but say, the servant of Allah and His messenger’? T have
hheard that someone said, 'By Allah, if Umar were deud, I would swear

Ac-Zuhti said that Anas ibn Malik said that on the day after Abd Bakr's
election in the shed, AbO Bakr sat on the pulpit, while “Umar got up 10
speak before him, After thanking and praising Allah as His due, he said, °O
people, yesterday I said things which I did not find in the Book of Allah nor
did the Prophet (pbuh) entrust them to me, However, I believed that the
Prophet (pbui) would manage our affairs and be the last of us to die. Alla

you firmly adhere to it, Allah will guide you as He guided him. Allah has
placed your affairs in the hands of the best one among you, the Companion
of the Prophet (pbuh), ¢the secand of two, when they (Muharnmad and Abi
Bakr! were in the cave 9", so vet Up and swear allegiance o him."

‘The people swore allegiance to Abii Bakr publicly after the allegiance
that took place in the shed the day before that. Abd Bakr said after praising Allah,

“O people! I have been given authority over you but Iam not the best of

you. IFT do well, help me. und if 1 do wrong, then correct me. Truth-

fulness is in honesty and falsehood is in treachery. The weak person

‘The Prophet's Burial

Ibn Isha Said that after allegiance had been sworn to Ab@ Bakr, on
‘Tuesday, people started preparing the Prophet (pbuh) for burial. “Abdullah
ibn Abi Bakr, Husayn ibn ° Abdillah, and others told fbn Ishag that “Ali ibn
‘Abi Talib, Al Abbas ibn “Abde!-Muualib, Al-Fad! ibnul- Abbas, Qutham
ibnul- Abbas, Usdmah ibn Zayd, and Shugran, the mawld of the Messenger
of Allah (pbuh), were those who washed him (pbuh). They also told him
that Aws ibn Khawli, one of Band *Awf ibnul-Khazraj, said to “AI ibn Abi
‘Talib, "I implore you by Allah, © "Ali, and by our portion in the Messenger
Of Allah (pbuh) (to let me enter and see him).” Aws was one of the Prophet's
Companions who witnessed the day of Badr. “Alf permitted him to enter,
and he attended the washing of the Prophet (pbuh). “Ali rested him on his
chest, while Al-Abbis, Al-Fadl, and Qutham turned him over along with
him. Usamah ibn Zayd and Shugrin poured water over him, as “Alf washed
im, having his shirt on him likewise not touching the Prophet's body with
his hand. Meanwhile “Alf said, "I ransom you with my father and my
mother. how good you are alive and dea

Nothing was seen of the Prophet from that which is usually seen of
ordinary corpses. “Avishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said, “When
they intended to wash the Prophet (pbuh). they differed. They did not know
whether to strip him of his clothes as they usually did with their dead or to
wash him with his clothes on, As they disputed, Allah cast a deep sleep
upon them all so that every man’s chin was sunk on his chest, Then an
unknown voice was heard from the direction of the Kabah, saying, ‘Wash
the Prophet (pbuh) with his clothes on So they woke up and went to the
Prophet (pbuh) anid washed him with his shirt on, pouring water on the shirt,
and rubbing him with the shirt between him and them.”

—@Q—



<br><br><br>

on Ishig said that when the Prophet (pbuh) had been washed he was
shrouded in three cloths, two of Suhar!! production and a striped sheath
\wrapped the one over the other.

Ibn “Abbas said, “Abd “Ubaydah ibnul-Jarrih used to dig tombs for the
People of Makkah, while Abd Talhah Zayd ibn Sahl used to make graves for
the people of Madinah with a niche in the side of the grave. When they
‘wanted to bury the Prophet (pbuh), Al- Abbas dispatched two men, one to
Aba “Ubaydah and the other to Abd Talhah. Al“Abbis supplicated, "O
Allah, choose for the Messenger of Allah.” The one who was sent to Abd
Talhah found him, so he dug a grave with a niche for the Prophet (pbuh).
‘When all arrangements for burial had been finished on Tuesday, he (pbuh)
‘was laid upon his bed in his house. The Muslims had disagreed over the
place of burial. Some favored burying him in his mosque, while others
thought to bury him with his Companions. Abd Bakr said, “I heard the
Messenger of Allah (pbuh) saying, 'No Prophet dies but is buried in the place
where he has died’. So the bed on which he died was drawn away and they
made a grave under it. Then the people entered to the Prophet (pbuh) to
offer (the funeral) prayer over him in groups; the men were the first,
followed by the women, and then the youngsters. No one led the prayers
over the Prophet (pbuh). He was buried in the middle of Wednesday night.”

*Alishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said that they knew nothing
about the burial of the Messenger of Allah (pbuh) until they had heard the
sound of pickaxes in the middle of Wednesday night. Those who went down
into the grave were “Ali ibn Abi Talib, Al-Fad! ibn “Abbas, Qutham ibn
“Abbas, and Shugrin, the Prophet's mawla. Aws ibn Khawli implored * Ali
by Allah and his portion in the Prophet (pbuh) to allow him descend. “Ali
allowed him, so he descended with the others. When the Prophet (pbuh) was
placed in his grave covered with earth, his mawid, Shugriin, took a piece of
velvet, which the Prophet (pbuh) used to take as a garment and something to
sit or Sleep on. and buried it in the grave saying, "By Allah, none will ever
wear it after you", Thus it was buried with the Prophet (pbuh).

Al-Mughirah ibn Shu’bah used to say that he was the last one to be with

the Prophet (pbuh). He said, "I deliberately threw my ring into the grave and
said that my ring has dropped. 1 did so in order that 1 might touch the

‘went to perform “Umrah with “Alt ibn Abi Talib during the caliphate of
“Umar, or Uthman, and he went to his sister Umm Hani’, the daughter of
‘Aba Talib, When he finished his “Umrah, water was poured out for him to
Wash himself. When he finished, a band of Tragis came in saying that they
had come to investigate a matter about which they would like him to give
‘some information. He said, I suppose that Al-Mughirah ibn Shu’bah has
told you that he was the last one to be with the Prophet (pbuh)? When they
said that it was so, he said, "The last one to be with the Prophet (pbuh) was
Qutham ibn Al- Abbas,

~Ubaydullh ibn “Abaillah ibn “Utbah reported that “A'ishah (may Allat
be pleased with her) satid to him, “The Prophet (pbuh) donned a black cloak
when he was seriously ill, He would put it on and off his face, saying, "May
Allah's curse be on the people w’ the graves of their Prophets as mosques,”
warning his nation from such a practice.

Also according to “Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her). the last
words that the Prophet (pbuh) enjoined were, "Nor nva religions are to be left
(altogether) in the Arabian Peninsula.” on Ishaq said that on the Prophet's
death, the Muslims were severely distressed. “A'ishah (may Allah be
pleased with her) said, "When the Prophet (pbuh) died, (many of) the Arabs
apostatized, Christianity and Judaism raised their heads, hypocrisy emerged,
and the Muslims became like rained-sheep on a wintry night for losing theit
Prophet (pbuh), until Allah gathered them through Abd Bakr.

Ibn Hisham said that, according to Abd “Ubaydah and other scholars,
‘when the Prophet (pbuh) died, most of the people of Makkah were about to
retreat from Islam to the extent that “Attab ibn Asia!" feared them, so he
concealed himself. Subayl ibn “Amr came and delivered a speech. After
praising Allah, he mentioned the death of the Prophet (pbuh) and said, “That
will only add to the power of Islam. Whosoever retreats from Islam we will
behead him." Thereupon the people changed their minds over what they had
intended to do and “Atab appeared again. This is the attitude which the
Prophet (pbuh) meant when he said to “Umar, "It may be that he will have
‘an attitude which you will not dispraise”,

Alléhu Akbar: “Allah is Greatet” is a literal translation of the Arabic
sentence “Alléhu Akbar". We use the word, “Greater” instead of, "the

means, “Allah is Greater” in the comparative mode. Yet, this does not
‘mean that He (Glory be to Him) is not the Greatest, nor does it mean that
there is anything that can be compared to Him. This is because when the
Muslim says it, he means He is “greatER" THAN anything else, which,
consequently, means He is the Greatest. This use gives more influence,
as it directly reminds the Muslim that Allah is "Greater" than anything
he may be doing, hearing. or secing, etc., at the time when it is being
Pronounced, This may be why it is used in Arabic in the comparative
mode, otherwise it should have been used as “Allah-ul-Akbar", in the

Greatest". Surely, Allah knows best.
